        "model_input": "Question:\nA state is the only state that imposes a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is included in U.S. GDP?

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nIn what state is the 1999 movie Magnolia' set?\n\nChoices:\n(A) South Carolina\n(B) Texas\n(C) Georgia\n(D) California\n\nAnswer:\n(D) California\n\nQuestion:\nWhat rank entitles a general in the US Army to wear three stars?\n\nChoices:\n(A) major general\n(B) corporal general\n(C) lieutenant general\n(D) brigadier general\n\nAnswer:\n(C) lieutenant general\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first American college to become coeducational?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Antioch College\n(B) Grinnell College\n(C) Dartmouth College\n(D) Oberlin College\n\nAnswer:\n",

At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\n________ men, on the average, begin engaging in sexual intercourse approximately two years later than ________ men do.\n\nChoices:\n(A) African Americans; whites and Latinos\n(B) Whites; African Americans and Latinos\n(C) Mexican Americans; African Americans and whites\n(D) Mexican Americans and whites; African Americans\n\nAnswer:\n(D) Mexican Americans and whites; African Americans\n\nQuestion:\nThe prevalence of HIV among Latino-Americans compared to other ethic groups in the U.S. is:\n\nChoices:\n(A) Higher than all other ethnic groups except African-Americans\n(B) Highest\n(C) Higher than in all other ethnic groups except African-Americans and\n(D) Native Americans\n\nAnswer:\n",

But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n—\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)\nWhich of the following events from either earlier or later in the colonial period can best be seen as being part of a continuity with the events described in the passage above?\n\nChoices:\n(A) The expulsion of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n(B) Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n(C) The Boston Tea Party.\n(D) The trial of John Peter Zenger.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\nQuestion:\nThe Gault site in south-central Texas has produced evidence from 13,000 years ago that Paleoindians chose this location based on the:\n\nChoices:\n(A) proximity to a local source of chert for quarrying and making stone tools.\n(B) nearness of the site to navigable rivers and the Gulf coast.\n(C) nearby location of migratory routes of large mammals such as bison.\n(D) abundance of wild game, plants, and fish in a rich and diverse woodland environment.\n\nAnswer:\n(A) proximity to a local source of chert for quarrying and making stone tools.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat caused a public uproar involving the National Security Agency in 2005?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Revelations that the NSA was monitoring the communications of American citizens without obtaining warrants\n(B) A scathing report condemning the George W.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nThe Federal Open Market Committee\n\nChoices:\n(A) has seven members.\n(B) promotes free trade.\n(C) is part of the Federal Reserve System.\n(D) advises the President of the United States.\n\nAnswer:\n(C) is part of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following would be included in U.S. GDP calculations?\n\nChoices:\n(A) High school students spending their Saturdays building homes for the homeless\n(B) An auto mechanic fixing his dentist’s car for a filling\n(C) A worker donating $200 to the Red Cross\n(D) A stay-at-home dad providing childcare for his children\n\nAnswer:\n(C) A worker donating $200 to the Red Cross\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following groups of Americans have the lowest rate of alcohol abuse?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Asian-American\n(B) White\n(C) Native-American\n(D) African-American\n\nAnswer:\n",

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following statements about voting patterns is NOT true?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Low-income Americans are more likely to vote Democratic than are upper-income Americans.\n(B) Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than are non-religious Americans.\n(C) Women are more likely to vote Democratic than are men.\n(D) Non-whites are more likely to vote Democratic than are whites.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than are non-religious Americans.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich one of the following North American associations is NOT correct?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Southeast—African Americans\n(B) Oklahoma and the Southwest—Native Americans\n(C) Southern prairie provinces—African Americans\n(D) Quebec and northern Maine—French Americans and French Canadians\n\nAnswer:\n(C) Southern prairie provinces—African Americans\n\nQuestion:\nThis question refers to the following information.\nAn Act to place certain restrictions on Immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants.\n…\n3.
