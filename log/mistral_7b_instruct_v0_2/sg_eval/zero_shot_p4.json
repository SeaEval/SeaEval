        "model_prediction": "The correct answer is (A) It enables people of different religions to live in harmony.\n\nExplanation:\nSecularism is important in Singapore because it promotes religious freedom and equality, allowing people of different religions to coexist peacefully and respectfully. It ensures that the government remains neutral towards all religions and does not favor any particular religion, which helps to prevent religious tensions and conflicts. Therefore, option A is the most probable answer. Options B, C, and D are not accurate descriptions of secularism in the Singapore context."
