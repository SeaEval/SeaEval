Question 2, on the other hand, asks about the easiest way to change one's identity, which is a different question altogether as it focuses on the process of altering one's identity rather than the changes that have occurred to identity as a concept."

        "model_prediction": "(A) The two questions are not semantically equivalent\n\nExplanation:\n\nAlthough both questions deal with Hillary Clinton's ethical issues and her supporters' attitudes towards them, they have slightly different focuses. Question 1 implies that Clinton's supporters don't care about her transgressions at all, while Question 2 suggests that they might tolerate or overlook them while considering other factors. These nuances make the questions distinct in meaning."
