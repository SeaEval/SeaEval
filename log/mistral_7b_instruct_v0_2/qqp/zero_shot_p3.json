        "model_prediction": "(B) The two questions are not semantically equivalent\n\nExplanation:\n\nAlthough both questions deal with the topic of imagining extra dimensions, they are not identical in meaning. The first question specifically asks about the 4th dimension or a tesseract, while the second question asks about extra dimensions in general. Therefore, the second question is more broad and could include the 4th dimension, but it also could refer to other extra dimensions beyond the 4th. Thus, the questions are not semantically equivalent."
