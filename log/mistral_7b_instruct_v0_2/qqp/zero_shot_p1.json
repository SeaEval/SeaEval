The first question asks for \"best eye clinics,\" which implies multiple clinics, whereas the second question asks for \"the best eye hospital,\" which implies a single institution. Therefore, the two questions have slightly different meanings and, thus, are not semantically equivalent."

        "model_prediction": "(A) The two questions are not semantically equivalent\n\nExplanation:\n\nAlthough both questions seem similar in meaning, they are not exactly the same. Question 1, \"What is it really like to be shot?\" implies a more comprehensive understanding of the experience, possibly including the physical sensations, emotional reactions, and aftermath. Question 2, \"What does it feel like to be shot?\" specifically asks about the sensations experienced during the shooting incident. While the sensation is certainly a part of the overall experience, it does not capture the full scope of Question 1."
