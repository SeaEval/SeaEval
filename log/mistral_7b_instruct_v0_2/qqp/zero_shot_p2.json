Both questions are asking about the usage of the brain, but they are phrased differently and have slightly different meanings. Question 1 is asking for a quantitative measurement as a percentage, while Question 2 is asking for a qualitative measurement of the extent or amount. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
