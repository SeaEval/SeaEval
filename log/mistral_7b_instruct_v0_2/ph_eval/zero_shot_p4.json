        "model_prediction": "The most accurate estimated combined number of islands from the Philippines and Indonesia is (D) 40,000. The Philippines has around 7,641 islands, and Indonesia has around 17,508 islands, totaling approximately 25,149 islands. However, some sources estimate that there might be as many as 60,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago when including smaller islets and atolls. Therefore, the combined total could be around 40,000 islands."
