Bill offered little sympathy, as they had other project-related issues to focus on, such as the absence and unresponsiveness of a team member named Alison. Stanley planned to talk to Del about their relationship when she returned, but Bill was skeptical of the outcome. They also discussed the division of tasks for their project, with Stanley taking the lead on analyzing tasks since Alison was unreachable."

XD\nLynn: Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper? :D\nCharlie: Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat?\nLynn: You've just spoiled all the fun! :P\nJess: Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth.\nCharlie: Do you really believe that dreams can mean something?\nJess: No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;)\nLynn: Well...\nJess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?\nLynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think?\nJess: I guess? \nCharlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.\nJess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?\nCharlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.\nLynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!\nSummary:\n",
        "model_prediction": "In a light-hearted conversation, Jess shared her dream about being a lion tamer and joked about traveling to Africa. Lynn suggested the possibility of meeting a handsome zookeeper, while Charlie brought up the idea of encountering a stray cat instead. The conversation shifted to a more serious note when Lynn expressed her belief that dreams might reflect our subconsciousness. Charlie added that strangers in dreams could be based on real-life encounters, and Jess pondered the possibility that the circus owner from her dream could be someone she had met before."

On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air.
