        "model_prediction": "(C) Contradiction\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe premise states that the shelter received information about the hijacking of the helicopter, specifically that it was a medevac helicopter and the location was 5 miles away. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the shelter was not informed about the hijacking at all. These two statements contradict each other, as the premise asserts that the shelter did receive information about the hijacking, while the hypothesis asserts that they did not."
