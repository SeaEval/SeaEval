These two statements contradict each other because the premise implies that the shelter was informed about the hijacking, while the hypothesis states that they were not."

In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that these expressions help further the argument. These two statements contradict each other, as they present opposing views on the role of these expressions in an argument."
