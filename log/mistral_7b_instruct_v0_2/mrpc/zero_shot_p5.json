However, both sentences are expressing that the use or application of the system was not \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve the stated interest in diversity."

Both sentences convey the same meaning, which is that the person has initiated a legal action to take possession of Beacon Hill's assets and has frozen more than $13 million of their funds. The difference between the two sentences lies in the use of synonyms and the order of the information presented. In Sentence 1, \"seize\" and \"has frozen\" could be considered synonyms in this context, and the order of the information is \"he has begun a court action to seize\" followed by \"has frozen more than $13"
