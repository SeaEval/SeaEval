The first sentence states that Sam took French classes from Adam because Adam was known to speak French fluently. This implies that Sam came to know that Adam speaks French fluently before taking the classes from him. Therefore, the second sentence, \"Sam was known to speak it fluently,\" can be inferred from the first sentence as it conveys the same meaning that Sam speaks French fluently.\n\nThus, the relationship between the two sentences is"
