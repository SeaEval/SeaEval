        "model_prediction": "A. The sentence implies that keeping thoughts hidden in the movie has the same great impact as the movie \"Quills\" had by showing them. This suggests that the sentence is expressing a neutral sentiment towards the movie's approach to conveying its message, but the use of the word \"achieves\" implies that the impact is effective, regardless of whether the thoughts are hidden or shown. However, the sentence does not explicitly express a positive or negative sentiment towards the hidden thoughts themselves, so the best answer is (A) Negative only because the sentence is neutral and does not express an overtly positive sentiment."
