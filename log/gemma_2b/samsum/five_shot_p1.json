Haven't seen them for ages!\nSophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.\nNoah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.\nSophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?\nNoah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of \"family care\" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\nSophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\nSophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\nNoah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\nSophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\nNoah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!\nSophie: Thank you for the quince!\n\nSummary:\nSophie accepts some quince from Noah. Noah has left the quince in a basket on his terrace and the twins can pick it up any time. The twins are in college. Noah's son is in the military.

No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\nSophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.\nNoah: OK.\nSophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield.

Like being married to your regiment!\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\nSophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\nNoah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\nSophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\nNoah: Sure.

I'll probably wait and work on the computer.\nDon: Bring a blanket :) It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours.\nHank: No shit :) Are you coming.\nDon: Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid :) \nHank: Hey, that's not fair! \nDon: I'll take the kids next time, I promise!\nHank: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

Like being married to your regiment!\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded.

Any good?\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\nClara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\nClara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\nNeela: How's that?\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.\nClara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\nNeela: See ya, love!\nClara: Bye!\n\nSummary:\nClara is rewatching Dear White People and strongly recommends it to Neela.\n\nDialogue:\nSarah: omg Laura! sorry you didn't get any replies!!!

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!\nAndy: No problem, speak soon.\n\nSummary:\nBetty's house has mould due to condensation.

From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death\nJack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?\nCharles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something\nMonica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:\nMonica: <file_other>, <file_other>\nKaren: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me\nKaren: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine\nJack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine\nCharles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much\nKaren: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better\nMonica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now\nJack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\nMonica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens\nCharles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm\nMonica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat\nCharles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me\n\nSummary:\nCoeliac disease makes it impossible to digest gluten.

But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good.\nGina: I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied.\nAlex: No spoilers, girls.\nCarrie: no worries ;)\nCarrie: And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt?\nGina: I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals.

Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure.

Why do you ask?\nClint: Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.?\nRonnie: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants.\nClint: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here.\nRonnie: Never...\nClint:: What do you mean?\nRonnie: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that.\nClint: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow\nRonnie: That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much\nKaren: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better\nMonica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now\nJack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\nMonica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens\nCharles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm\nMonica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat\nCharles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me\n\nSummary:\nCoeliac disease makes it impossible to digest gluten. Charles feels bloated and gained weight recently. Monica stopped eating lactose. Charles had a blood test.\n\nDialogue:\nDan: Guys, so are we going out on Sat?\nTim: I'm ready when you are\nChris: I'm OK too, in the centre right?\nTom: I'm out guys sorry. \nDan: come on Tom, what's wring this time\nTom: told ya before. party at in-laws\nChris: always the same story right\nMartin: right guys, so what time?\nTim: start @8? finish. 8 if we're lucky\nDan: yeah, i need to be home at 2 and ready to drive on Sunday noon\nChris: so you takin it easy this time\nMartin: i guess i'd have to as well\nTim: guys you sound like 60 yos\nChris: Tim, are the last two standing or what?\nTim: i gather\nDan: you two will also grow up one day. \n\nSummary:\nDan,Tim, Chris and Martin will meet at 8.

With a totally inappropriate suggestion? Puhleeze.\nStewart: I can't wait to vote for anyone else but him.\nShari: I know what you mean. Half my friends voted for him just to see what would happen!

Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \nVic: What do u mean?\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources.

I don't post that many pictures online. \nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering.

Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point.
