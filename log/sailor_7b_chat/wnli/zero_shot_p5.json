Sentence2: Sam was known to speak it fluently.\n\nChoices:\n(A) Not Entailment\n(B) Entailment\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "model_prediction": "A) Not Entailment. \n\nThe first sentence states that Sam took French classes from Adam because he was known to speak it fluently. The second sentence only states that Sam was known to speak it fluently, but does not provide any information about why he might have taken French classes. Therefore, there is no logical connection between the two sentences and they do not entail each other."

        "model_prediction": "A) Entailment. \n\nThe first sentence states that the drain is clogged and needs to be removed, which implies that it must also have been filled with hair as stated in the second sentence. Therefore, the second sentence logically follows from the information provided in the first sentence."
