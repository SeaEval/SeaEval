Poverty is defined as a household's total annual income that falls below the poverty line, which is set by the federal government and updated annually to account for changes in living expenses. This definition takes into account the cost of basic necessities like food, shelter, clothing, and transportation, and adjusts for differences in regional costs of living. The poverty line is intended to provide a minimum standard of living for households with certain characteristics, such as number of people or disability status."
