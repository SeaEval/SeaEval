In this case, options I and III involve goods that were produced in the United States and sold within its borders, so they would be included in the calculation of GDP. Option II involves an Italian product being sold in the United States, which means it was not produced within the United States and therefore would not contribute to GDP. Option IV involves a Canadian citizen producing a product in the United States, but selling it outside of the United States, so it would also not contribute to GDP"
