The premise states that touching an object and pointing to it while looking at someone can help them avoid getting attention, but the hypothesis suggests that they will never get attention by pointing at an object while looking at another person. This contradicts the premise, as pointing to an object while looking at someone would be seen as a sign of attention and could potentially attract their attention.
