Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \nSusan: No problem!

Yes, but you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say? They are puzzles. It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival. Very interesting.

Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account?\nMarietta: Yes. Does the checking account come with a debit card?\nJesse: Yes. Actually, both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines, so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction.\nMarietta: That's very convenient.\nJesse: It is. Our customers really like it. Do you have any other questions about your new accounts?\nMarietta: Yes. What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft?\nJesse: The maximum is $ 1000.\nMarietta: Is there a penalty for having an overdraft?\nJesse: Yes, but it's not much. You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account. It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards.\nMarietta: That's true.

And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\nNatassia: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\nJoline: Andrew! That won't help. Next \nNatassia: Oh, next? \nJoline: . Oh yeah. So, first of all, smaller portions \nNatassia: Okay.\nJoline: Then, you need to make sure you eat a good, well-balanced breakfast first thing in the morning \nNatassia: I do that. \nJoline: And then you follow that up with smaller meals throughout the day, cause, you know what? If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks.\nNatassia: Uh ... \nJoline: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night.\nNatassia:  What? Like what?\nJoline:  Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat. You have to throw away ... Oh my gosh!\nNatassia:  What?\nJoline: That's all you have in your freezer! You've only got ice cream in here! You're going to have to throw that all away?\nNatassia: It's low-calorie ice cream.\nJoline: Low cal. No, it's not low-cal. Look right here. Andrew! That's all the food you've got in here is ice cream.\nNatassia: Well, what else, what else?\nJoline: Also, what else are you eating? \nNatassia: Well, you know ...\nJoline: I mean, seriously. All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? \nNatassia: Well ...\nJoline: Okay, you got to cut out the fast food. When you know the manger of McDonalds by name, and he's your best buddy on Facebook, you know that you're going to McDonalds or any fast food place too much.\nNatassia: Uh, this is going to be tough.\nJoline: Yeah. It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. \nNatassia:  Oh, well. \nJoline: cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\nNatassia: I don't drink five gallons.\nJoline: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups! How many times do you refill them?\nNatassia: Well, then, drink what?\nJoline: Water!\nNatassia: Water?\nJoline: It's really good for you.\nNatassia: Oh, this is going to be tough.\nJoline: It might be.\nOutput:\n",

Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \nSusan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. \nEmily: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! ",

I have some questions about my paycheck. \nSusan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \nSusan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. \nEmily: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! \nOutput:\n",

I don't have any plans. What kind of things does she like to do?\nJohn: Actually, I haven't seen her for 3 years. She lives so far away, but this will be her first time on a college campus. She is still in high school so she probably enjoys anything on campus.\nSusan: Well, there is a music festival in the auditorium. That's a possibility. Only I hope it doesn't snow, they're predicting 68 inches for the weekend, everything will be closed down then.\nJohn: Well, how about for the time being planning on dropping her off at your place on my way to work around 11:00. But if there is a snowstorm I'll give you a call and see if we can figure something else out.\nSusan: Sounds good. We can touch base on Friday night when we have a better idea of the forecast.\nJohn: I hope this works out.\nOutput:\n",

Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \nSusan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.
