This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is NOT true of executive orders?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Executive orders bypass congressional approval.\n(B) Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\n(C) Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s.\n(D) Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions.\n\nQuestion:\nAll of the following contribute to lower voting rates among Americans in the 18-to-25 age bracket EXCEPT\n\nChoices:\n(A) frequent relocation of one's primary residence\n(B) the remoteness of most political issues to the daily lives of young people\n(C) the fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21\n(D) college attendance in a state other than one's home state\n\nAnswer:\n(C) the fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21\n\nQuestion:\nIn American government, the power to declare war rests with\n\nChoices:\n(A) the secretary of defense.\n(B) Congress.\n(C) the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n(D) the president of the United States.\n\nAnswer:\n",

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the most rapidly growing religion in the United States today?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Islam\n(B) Christianity\n(C) Buddhism\n(D) Hinduism\n\nAnswer:\n(A) Islam\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following has been true of the Republican Party since the 1980s?\n\nChoices:\n(A) It has become more antagonistic to business interests.\n(B) It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.\n(C) It has become aligned with civil libertarians.\n(D) It has come to be dominated by labor unions.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.\n\nQuestion:\nYour new ‘client is a 37-year-old woman whose symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.

The immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs in this section (hereinafter called \"prohibited immigrants\") is prohibited, namely\n(a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer;\n(b) Any person in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable organisation;\n…\n(g) Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required by Australia…\nImmigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia)\nWhereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof;\nTherefore,\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or having so come after the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States.\nSEC. 2. That the master of every vessel who shall knowingly bring within the United States on such vessel, and land or permit to be landed, any Chinese laborer, from any foreign port or place, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each and every such Chinese laborer so brought, and may be also imprisoned for a term not exceeding one year….\nChinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)\nThe emphasis on language in the first passage is most safely interpreted as\n\nChoices:\n(A) an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin.\n(B) a measure to ensure that all immigrants possessed useful expertise.\n(C) a concern for high educational standards in a rapidly growing society.\n(D) a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race.\n\nQuestion:\nThe migration streams into the United States between 1980 and the present have been primarily composed of emigrants from which of the following regions?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Asia and Latin America\n(B) Europe and North Africa\n(C) Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania\n(D) Central Europe and Australia\n\nAnswer:\n(A) Asia and Latin America\n\nQuestion:\nThis question refers to the following information.\n\"As our late Conduct at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation & a great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty to lay before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears, to us. . . .\n\"If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable Attachment in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend them & an utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more recent Facts. When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense, determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition. But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n—\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)\nWhich of the following events from either earlier or later in the colonial period can best be seen as being part of a continuity with the events described in the passage above?\n\nChoices:\n(A) The expulsion of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n(B) Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n(C) The Boston Tea Party.\n(D) The trial of John Peter Zenger.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\nQuestion:\nThis question refers to the following information.\nHere is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n—Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nThe situation faced by the young women in the passage above is most directly comparable to which of the following?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Slaves in the antebellum South\n(B) American revolutionaries in the 1770s\n(C) Populist farmers in the 1890s\n(D) Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s\n\nAnswer:\n(D) Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s\n\nQuestion:\nVoters in which of the following categories would be LEAST likely to vote?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Voters aged 18-29\n(B) Blue-collar workers who belong to a union\n(C) Voters who are active in their political parties\n(D) Professionals\n\nAnswer:\n(A) Voters aged 18-29\n\nQuestion:\nIn what US city can you find the Basketball Hall of Fame?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Cooperstown New York\n(B) Canton Ohio\n(C) Springfield Massachusetts\n(D) Lawrence Kansas\n\nAnswer:\n",

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nAnorexia nervosa is a life-threatening illness that can lead to permanent physiological changes (such as brittle bones) and even death.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the most popular month for weddings in America?\n\nChoices:\n(A) January\n(B) November\n(C) August\n(D) May\n\nAnswer:\n(C) August\n\nQuestion:\nThis question refers to the following information.\n\"I was once a tool of oppression\nAnd as green as a sucker could be\nAnd monopolies banded together\nTo beat a poor hayseed like me.\n\"The railroads and old party bosses\nTogether did sweetly agree;\nAnd they thought there would be little trouble\nIn working a hayseed like me. . . .\"\n—\"The Hayseed\"\nThe song, and the movement that it was connected to, highlight which of the following developments in the broader society in the late 1800s?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Corruption in government—especially as it related to big business—energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\n(B) The two-party system of the era broke down and led to the emergence of an additional major party that was able to win control of Congress within ten years of its founding.\n(C) A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, was able to exert a great deal of leverage over federal legislation.\n(D) Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\n\nAnswer:\n",
