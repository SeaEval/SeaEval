We'd learned a lot about the environment in our science lessons, so I decided to see what I could do in my own life rather than just act completely helpless. And I knew the rest of my family would be interested.\nTim: Did you find it easy to get information?\nSimeon: Yeah, I discovered there were lots of people at my age trying to be green. I'd always gone to school by car. Catching a bus would be better, but there's no bus where we live. So I've gone for riding my bike to school now.\nTim: OK. And what about being green once you're actually at school?\nSimeon: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers.\nTim: And what about the school cafeteria?\nSimeon: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too.

What on earth happened to you?\nNatassia: Why are you always so blunt?\nJoline: Well, I'm your big sister. I'm ... what am I? Three years older than you, and I can be blunt if I want. Besides, you used to say stuff like that to me all of the time. You used to call me fatso all the time when I was little.\nNatassia: Oh, yeah, well, to be honest, uh ..., I started changing my life .... yesterday.\nJoline: Oh good!\nNatassia: I'm on the Wafu Diet.\nJoline: What? I've never even heard of the Wafu Diet. What is that?\nNatassia: Ah, it's too difficult to explain. I found information about it in my junk mail the other day ...\nJoline: What? You read your junk mail? No one reads their junk mail.\nNatassia: ... and I signed up for it, and it only cost $490.\nJoline: You're serious?\nNatassia: Yeah.\nJoline:  Four hundred and ninety bucks? \nNatassia: Yeah. \nJoline: Like every month or every week or ...?\nNatassia: I didn't check that ... ah, ah, but, but, but, but ...

I ... if you want to lose weight, you need to do it the right way.\nNatassia: Well, like what?\nJoline: Well, okay.\nNatassia: Okay, uh, well, look. Look at my running shoes over there.\nJoline: Andrew. They're still in the box. \nNatassia: Well ... \nJoline: Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful. It's great, but you also need to learn how to eat right. For example, you need to eat smaller portions. And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\nNatassia: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\nJoline: Andrew! That won't help. Next \nNatassia: Oh, next? \nJoline: . Oh yeah. So, first of all, smaller portions \nNatassia: Okay.\nJoline: Then, you need to make sure you eat a good, well-balanced breakfast first thing in the morning \nNatassia: I do that. \nJoline: And then you follow that up with smaller meals throughout the day, cause, you know what? If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks.\nNatassia: Uh ... \nJoline: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night.\nNatassia:  What? Like what?\nJoline:  Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat.

You're going to have to throw that all away?\nNatassia: It's low-calorie ice cream.\nJoline: Low cal. No, it's not low-cal. Look right here. Andrew! That's all the food you've got in here is ice cream.\nNatassia: Well, what else, what else?\nJoline: Also, what else are you eating? \nNatassia: Well, you know ...\nJoline: I mean, seriously. All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? \nNatassia: Well ...\nJoline: Okay, you got to cut out the fast food. When you know the manger of McDonalds by name, and he's your best buddy on Facebook, you know that you're going to McDonalds or any fast food place too much.\nNatassia: Uh, this is going to be tough.\nJoline: Yeah. It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. \nNatassia:  Oh, well. \nJoline: cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\nNatassia: I don't drink five gallons.\nJoline: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups! How many times do you refill them?\nNatassia: Well, then, drink what?\nJoline: Water!\nNatassia: Water?\nJoline: It's really good for you.\nNatassia: Oh, this is going to be tough.\nJoline: It might be.\n\nSummary:\n",

Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \nSusan: No problem!

I've also never been outside the country before.\nAndreas: I think the people in Russia are fast movers by nature, at least in the big cities. Public places are still very slow because they haven't tried to do business any differently than they used to.\nMariellen: But in Canada, it's the opposite?\nAndreas: Right. The government here does a great job of solving problems and using new technology to make businesses work better. But I think Canadians are just more calm in general than Russians are... and they're definitely more relaxed than Americans!\nMariellen: Well, I agree with you about that last part!\n\nSummary:\n",
        "model_prediction": " In the conversation, Andreas shares his observations on the differences between Russia and Canada. He notes that in Russia, things happen quickly, people talk fast, and good deals disappear quickly. However, in Canada, people seem more relaxed. He also points out that while things are fast in Russia, services at the bank, post office, and supermarket can be slow. Andreas attributes these differences to the nature of the people in each country, with Russians being fast movers and Canadians being more calm and relaxed.</s>"

Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end.\nMs. Ross: Better to have buffet lunch?\nMr. Fisher: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.\nMs. Ross: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.\nMr. Fisher: Oh, that'll be fine.\nMs. Ross: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.\nMr. Fisher: Free, fine, yes.\nMs. Ross: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?\nMr. Fisher: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\nMs. Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?\nMr. Fisher: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.\nMs. Ross: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal.\nMr. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before.\nMs. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday?\nMr. Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...\nMs. Ross: 100?!\nMr. Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.\nMs. Ross: Yes, but the room won't...\nMr. Fisher: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.\nMs. Ross: But what if they do? This room is the only one we have that day--there's a wedding reception in the banqueting rooms, so we...\nMr. Fisher: Well, in that case, I suppose...\n\nSummary:\n",
