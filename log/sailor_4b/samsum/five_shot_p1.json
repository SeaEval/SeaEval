I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation.

It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;)\nLynn: Well...\nJess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?\nLynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think?\nJess: I guess? \nCharlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.\nJess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?\nCharlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.\nLynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!\n\nSummary:\nJess dreamt she was a lion tamer. Lynn believes that dreams mean something.

Let's get those last minute trade request sent.\nRick: So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb??\nSean: Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB!\nJohn: I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait...\nRick: Crazy it happens though! he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar.\nJohn: In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR  for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances.\nSean: Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\nRick: people's evidence #658 why the QB rule doesn't work.\nJohn: I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year.\nSean: I guess we will have to talk about after the season.\nRick: Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. That solves a large percentage of the issue tho\nSean: 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league...\nJohn: as I said, we can look at if after the season. I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far.\n\nSummary:\nSean reminds the guys about trade deadline today. Rick wants to vote. John will look at it after the season.\n\nDialogue:\nAnne: You were right, he was lying to me :/\nIrene: Oh no, what happened?\nJane: who? that Mark guy?\nAnne: yeah, he told me he's 30, today I saw his passport - he's 40\nIrene: You sure it's so important?\nAnne: he lied to me Irene\n\nSummary:\n",

It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\nClara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\nClara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\nNeela: How's that?\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure.

Why?\nRob: When can you be at the office?\nRob: I've got to talk to you.\nPhil: What's so urgent?\nRob: Can't tell you.\nPhil: What?!\nRob: I mean can't tell you now.\nRob: I need to see you in person.\nPhil: Well, it'll have to wait till tomorrow.

See you tomorrow then.\nPhil: See you.\n\nSummary:\nRob is looking for Phil. Rob needs to talk with him. Phil will come over to his office tomorrow morning.\n\nDialogue:\nAndy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!\nAndy: No problem, speak soon.\n\nSummary:\nBetty's house has mould due to condensation.

Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \nVic: What do u mean?\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources.

And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside.

I don't post that many pictures online. \nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering.

I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\nPhil: And does this motivate u to train?\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \nNancy: What do u think about Tumblr?\nPhil: What?\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\nNancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there.

They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.\nSophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.\nSophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\nNoah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\nSophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.\nNoah: OK.\nSophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?\nNoah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again.

They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\nSophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\nSophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\nNoah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\nSophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\nNoah: Sure.

Any good?\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\nClara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\nClara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\nNeela: How's that?\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.\nClara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\nNeela: See ya, love!\nClara: Bye!\n\nSummary:\nClara is rewatching Dear White People and strongly recommends it to Neela.\n\nDialogue:\nBennett: i'm in town!! let's meet!!!\nCynthia: YES! i'd love that\nBennett: our usual place?\nCynthia: no, actually, i'd like us to go to this new bistro i discovered\nBennett: i'm intrigued, what's so special about it?\nCynthia: it's super hipster, super cool\nCynthia: people bring their dogs and everything\nBennett: ok, as long as it's hygienic i'm fine\nCynthia: it's clean cool and their food is delicious\nBennett: ok, i can't wait\n\nSummary:\nCynthia and Bennett will go to a new bistro she discovered. \n\nDialogue:\nFlo: OMG, I can't get into the salon until the 6th!\nGina: What?

And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P\nJosie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.\nStefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.\nJosie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?\nStefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.\nJosie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.\nStefano: Really? What did he say?\nJosie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.\nStefano: What? Rotfl!\nJosie: That's what Salman said...\nStefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum...\nJosie: De gustiBus!\nStefano: I know, it was a typo!\nJosie: Disgusting pus!\nStefano: Hahaha.\nJosie: Yuk! That's so creepy.\nStefano: You're the one who said it!\nJosie: I know. ;)\n\nSummary:\nJosie finds Eco's novel \"Foucault's Pendulum\" nerdy.
