As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende.

He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nIn the film 'Easy Rider' what emblem is on the back of Peter Fonda's leather jacket?\n\nChoices:\n(A) American flag\n(B) Harley-Davidson logo\n(C) peace symbol\n(D) two white doves\n\nAnswer:\n(A) American flag\n\nQuestion:\nWhat rank entitles a general in the US Army to wear three stars?\n\nChoices:\n(A) major general\n(B) corporal general\n(C) lieutenant general\n(D) brigadier general\n\nAnswer:\n(C) lieutenant general\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Charlotte North Carolina\n(B) Plymouth Massachusetts\n(C) St Augustine Florida\n(D) Newport News Virginia\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Plymouth Massachusetts\n\nQuestion:\nThe major beneficiary of Medicaid in the U.S. is:\n\nChoices:\n(A) The elderly\n(B) Undocumented residents\n(C) Single men\n(D) Women and children\n\nAnswer:\n",

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nThis question refers to the following information.\n\"As our late Conduct at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation & a great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty to lay before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears, to us. . . .\n\"If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable Attachment in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend them & an utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more recent Facts.

Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nPoverty as defined by the United States government is best understood as\n\nChoices:\n(A) the index value of government services such as Medicaid and public housing\n(B) an absolute level set in the 1960s and since adjusted to reflect inflation at the consumer level\n(C) a concept based on lifestyle and measured on a sliding scale based on the needs of an individual\n(D) the concept of relative deprivation and is based on changes in the distribution of income\n\nAnswer:\n(B) an absolute level set in the 1960s and since adjusted to reflect inflation at the consumer level\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of these college football programs has produced the most Heisman Trophy winners?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Michigan\n(B) Notre Dame\n(C) Oklahoma\n(D) USC\n\nAnswer:\n",

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of these college football programs has produced the most Heisman Trophy winners?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Michigan\n(B) Notre Dame\n(C) Oklahoma\n(D) USC\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Notre Dame\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the most popular month for weddings in America?\n\nChoices:\n(A) January\n(B) November\n(C) August\n(D) May\n\nAnswer:\n(C) August\n\nQuestion:\nWho was president of the United States when Bill Clinton was born?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Herbert Hoover\n(B) Dwight Eisenhower\n(C) Harry S Truman\n(D) Franklin Roosevelt\n\nAnswer:\n",
