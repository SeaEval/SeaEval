        "model_prediction": "The correct answer is (A) campaign more heavily in states with large populations.\n\nThe Electoral College system gives more weight to votes cast in populous states than it does to votes cast in sparsely populated states. This is because each state is allocated a number of electors based on its population, with larger states allocating more electors than smaller states. This means that candidates need to win a majority of the electoral votes cast in a state in order to win the presidency."
