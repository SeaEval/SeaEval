My son is only 16 year old and he has to sleep in the airport, with no mean to leave his luggage as he has no ticket.\nAir France: Hello Sybille, we're very sorry . We could offer you a departure on flight DL140 from Minneapolis to Paris. We'll return to you.\nSybille: My  phone number is XXXX, please call me back as soon as possible\nSybille: Hello, i was again on line with people from the  short number. They told me that they've done everything possible but my payment can't be accepted because the flight is operated by Delta. Please consider a young stuck in US with no possibilites  for coming back just because of Delta and Air France sharing code, can't  share payment. Shame on you.\nAir France: We'll get in touch with Delta US  and return to you quickly\nSybille: thanks a lot\nAir France: We just send  you by email the new ticket for you son. We remain at your disposal.\nSybille: Thanks a lot, you're more efficient than the  hotline.\n\nSummary:\n",

Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air.
