Hilary has the keys and offers to meet up with the others at lunchtime or after to hand them over. Benjamin is tired and wants to take a nap, so he considers meeting Hilary at lunchtime to get the keys. However, he's hesitant because Hilary is meeting with some French researchers who study the history of food in colonial Mexico, and Benjamin is not interested in that topic. Despite his initial reservations, Hilary and Elliot convince Benjamin to join them for lunch and then take the keys and go nap."

Fancy joining? \nZadie: Sure! But what's \"stuff\"? 😂\nFinn: lol So apparently it's a place were random people from \"Latin America\" (meaning fuck knows which countries) started running small businesses and restaurant, and a nice little community was formed\nZadie: Oh cool \nFinn: Then capitalism came and it's all going to be demolished soon, so it's like the last chance to go\nZadie: What a shame :( Yeah, I haven't had Latin American 😂 food for ages so I'm totally up for it\nFinn: Can't wait to taste this cuisine of unspecified Latino origin lol\nZadie: 😂😂😂\nFinn: But we can specify time and place if and only if you wish \nZadie: I might be tempted to lol I'd say early evening, 2-ish?\nFinn: Yeah, that's fine by me. So most of the places we want to visit are in this Elephant and Castle shopping centre. Shall I see you at the main entrance, wherever that is \nZadie: 2 o'clock at unspecified main entrance then? Sounds good to mw\nFinn: Yer\nZadie: Cool, see you there! And thanks so much for remembering about me 💜💜💜\nFinn: Thanks for saying yes to such an ill-defined plan lmao \nZadie: Ha ha You know I love those\nFinn: See you tomorrow then \nZadie: Yep Call me if you get lost\nFinn: I will I will 🤙 byeeee \nZadie: Toodles\n\nSummary:\n",
