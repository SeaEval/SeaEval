Haven't seen them for ages!\nSophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.\nNoah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.\nSophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?\nNoah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of \"family care\" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\nSophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\nSophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\nNoah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\nSophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\nNoah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!\nSophie: Thank you for the quince!\nSummary:\n",

I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose\nMary: What was it this time?\nKate: Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him\nKate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him\nMary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say?\nKate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it\nMary: oh god\nKate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck\nMary: What did you tell him?\nKate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.\nMary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that\nKate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once\nMary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him\nKate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself\nKate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US\nMary: Oh my god he said that?\nKate: Yes :/\nMary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much\nKate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him\nMary: No wonder\nSummary:\n",
