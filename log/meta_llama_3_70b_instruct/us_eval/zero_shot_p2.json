Prior to the New Deal, African Americans had traditionally voted Republican, but Roosevelt's policies and programs, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, which provided jobs and relief to African Americans, helped to win them over to the Democratic Party. This shift in allegiance was a key factor in the Democratic Party's electoral success during the 1930"
