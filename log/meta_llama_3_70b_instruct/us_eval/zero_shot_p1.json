        "model_prediction": "The correct answer is (A) A major shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition was successful in part because of a significant shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Prior to the New Deal, African Americans had traditionally voted Republican, but Roosevelt's policies and programs, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, which provided jobs and relief to African Americans, helped to win them over to the Democratic Party. This shift in allegiance was a key factor in Roosevelt's electoral success during the 1930s."
