We have a choice of different views, and each one is a different price. For instance, a room with a city view is 175 a night.\n M: 175 a night?! That's highway robbery!\n W: If you think that's too steep, there are a few other options. We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 a night or a room with an obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 a night.\n M: I don't really care which type of room we get as long as we don't end up with a room on the ground floor. I don't like having people walking back and forth outside my window all night.\n W: Okay, I can request a room on an upper floor. You really don't have a preference?\n M: No, not really.\n W: There is a penthouse room for 400 a night.\n M: What?!

Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat. Dessert and drinks are not included.\n Jason: It's been really a nice trip.\n Berry: Well, Rio was not the experience we had hoped for, and we feel that this city is over-publicized. But anyway it's cool to have been there.\n\nQuestion:\nBerry was shocked in Rio because ______.\n\nChoices:\n(A) there was a contrast between the rich and poor\n(B) people worked very hard while on vacation\n(C) travelers spent their time sleeping rather than sightseeing\n\nAnswer:\n",

Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n Guest: My pleasure.",

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water.

It seems to me that creative writing is a process of revelation, really, rather than of creativity in the ordinary sense.\n W: When you're planning the basic structure, do you like to go away to be sure that you're by yourself?\n M: I need to be by myself certainly, absolutely. I can't even bear anybody else in the house. I don't mind much where I am as long as I've got enough space to write, but I need to be completely alone.\n W: Is that very important to you?\n M: Oh, yes. I've never been lonely in all my life.\n W: How extraordinary! Never?\n M: No, never.\n W: You're very lucky. Someone once said that there's a bit of ice at the heart of every writer.\n M: Yes. I think this is true. The writer can stand aside from experience and look at it, watch it happening. There is this 'detachment' and I realize that there are obviously experiences which would overwhelm everyone. But very often, a writer can appear to stand aside, and this detachment makes people feel there's a bit of ice in the heart.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the man say about writers?\n\nChoices:\n(A) They have experiences similar to the characters'.\n(B) They look at the world in a detached manner.\n(C) They rely heavily on their own imagination.\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "model_prediction": "The man says that writers have an \"ice\" or detachment in their hearts, allowing them to observe events and experiences without being overwhelmed by them. Therefore, the correct choice is (B)."

Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight?

The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n M: Indeed it has.\n F: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n M: Yes.

In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman?\n F: Is that the Walkman?\n M: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial.\n F: How big is the whole thing?\n M: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms.\n F: Was it a success from the start?\n M: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price!\n F: Really?\n M: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections.\n F: Well, you never can tell! How big was the initial production?\n M: The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they still couldn't keep up with the demand.\n F: So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher.\n M: It was much more radical than that! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model.\n F: Oh, what's it like?\n M: Well, it's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less...\n F: Mmmm.\n M: and the components were designed from scratch.\n F: And what about production levels?\n M: They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market!\n F: Wow! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n M: Indeed it has.\n F: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n M: Yes.

What kind of apartment is it?\n Gavin: It's a two-bedroom apartment.\n Diane: What floor is it on?\n Gavin: Why do you need to know that?\n Diane: Because it affects the cost of the insurance. An apartment on the ground floor isn't as protected as others and there's more chance of a break-in.\n Gavin: Really? I didn't know that. It's on the third, no... second floor.\n Diane: Second... and how much is the rent?\n Gavin: It's $615 per month.\n Diane: Good, and where is it located?\n Gavin: In Biggins St. South Hill.\n Diane: I see. And what things did you want to insure?\n Gavin: Well, what do you recommend?\n Diane: Well, the most important things are those, which you would normally find in a home, things like the television, fridge and so on.\n Gavin: I see. Well, I've got a fridge and a stereo system, which I've just bought from a friend.\n Diane: And how much did you pay for the fridge?\n Gavin: Err, $450.\n Diane: 50 or 15?\n Gavin: 50, and the stereo system costs $1,150.\n Diane: Have you got a television?\n Gavin: Yes, but it's very old and not worth much.\n Diane: OK. Well, is there anything else you want to insure?\n Gavin: Yes, I've got a couple of watches and my CDs and books.\n Diane: How much do you think they're worth?\n Gavin: The watches are worth $1,000...\n Diane: For both of them?\n Gavin: No. Each one and, all together, the CDs and books cost me about $400.\n Diane: OK, so the value of everything you want to insure is $4,000.\n Gavin: How much will the insurance cost?\n Diane: Let me see, $4,000 divided by... plus 10%... right, so this kind of insurance, err, that's Private Contents insurance, it comes to $184.00 for a twelve-month period.\n Gavin: $184.00.

I was told by the landlord that it would be a good idea to get some insurance for the furniture and other personal possessions.\n Diane: Fine. Well, let's get some details. What kind of apartment is it?\n Gavin: It's a two-bedroom apartment.\n Diane: What floor is it on?\n Gavin: Why do you need to know that?\n Diane: Because it affects the cost of the insurance. An apartment on the ground floor isn't as protected as others and there's more chance of a break-in.\n Gavin: Really? I didn't know that.

Well, is there anything else you want to insure?\n Gavin: Yes, I've got a couple of watches and my CDs and books.\n Diane: How much do you think they're worth?\n Gavin: The watches are worth $1,000...\n Diane: For both of them?\n Gavin: No. Each one and, all together, the CDs and books cost me about $400.\n Diane: OK, so the value of everything you want to insure is $4,000.\n Gavin: How much will the insurance cost?\n Diane: Let me see, $4,000 divided by... plus 10%... right, so this kind of insurance, err, that's Private Contents insurance, it comes to $184.00 for a twelve-month period.\n Gavin: $184.00.

Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow!

Begin by thoroughly reading the dialogue, and then provide your answer to the question by selecting the most suitable choices.\n\nDialogue:\nM: In what way is your school different from other schools?\n W: Our school is for all children because a few of the children are physically disabled, and some of the others have learning difficulties. In our school, we have faster learners and slower learners.\n M: And is yours the only school like this?\n W: That's correct. Up till now, disabled children and those with learning difficulties were sent to special schools. They grew up in a different world.\n M: What made you decide to start this new school?\n W: We realized that disabled children had no knowledge of children in ordinary schools. We thought it was important that all human beings should grow up together.\n M: Do the slower learners hold up the faster learners?\n W: No. For some classes, slow learners and faster learners are separated. In other classes they all work together.\n M: How does that work?\n W: Well. The faster learners help the slower learners. That way they become very skilled as teachers. When it's time for the faster learners to do a task or do their homework, they do it more quickly and better too.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy did the woman decide to start this school?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Because the world is changing.\n(B) To bring all types of children together for their education.\n(C) Because there were not enough special school.\n\nAnswer:\n",

And considering the patrol prices, it'll be a little too expensive, I suppose.\n M: Well, yes, it probably costs you about 70 pounds depending on your car.\n W: The car is the trouble. Now, what about the coach? I've been told that's fairly reasonable.\n M: Oh, it is. It costs twenty pounds in fact from London to Edinburgh.\n W: Hmm, that's not too bad.\n M: But it takes about ten hours.\n W: Oh, no. What about the train then?\n M: Let me see. It takes five hours ill fact from London to Edinburgh. It costs 62 pounds for a single.\n W: 62 pounds for a single ticket. Wow, that's a lot of money. You see, what I'd really like to do is to go by plane. Can you tell me about that?\n M: Yes, of course. Let me see, 78 pounds for a single. But it takes just over an hour.\n W: Really?\n M: Yes, you're there in no time.\n W: Wonderful. That'll be a wonderful start to the holiday.\n M: Shall I book a ticket?\n W: Well, look. I really ought to think about it. Thank you very much for your help.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n Guest: My pleasure.",

        "model_input": "You will receive a dialogue along with a question. Begin by thoroughly reading the dialogue, and then provide your answer to the question by selecting the most suitable choices.\n\nDialogue:\nProgram Host: Hi and welcome to our new show, Exotic Animal Kingdom, a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old. In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned?

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n Guest: My pleasure.",

        "model_input": "You will receive a dialogue along with a question. Begin by thoroughly reading the dialogue, and then provide your answer to the question by selecting the most suitable choices.\n\nDialogue:\nProgram Host: Hi and welcome to our new show, Exotic Animal Kingdom, a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old. In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned?

        "model_prediction": "The best lighting scenario for a bearded dragon in captivity would be option (A), an inside enclosure with a UV light and basking lamp. This would provide the necessary sunlight and heat for the dragon to thrive. Option B, a heating rock and a basking lamp in an aquarium, may not provide enough natural sunlight and may cause the dragon to become overheated. Option C, a completely glassed-enclosed aquarium with occasional sunlight, may not provide enough natural sunlight and may cause the dragon to become dehydrated due to lack of ventilation."

In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman?\n F: Is that the Walkman?\n M: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial.\n F: How big is the whole thing?\n M: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms.\n F: Was it a success from the start?\n M: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price!\n F: Really?\n M: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections.\n F: Well, you never can tell! How big was the initial production?\n M: The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they still couldn't keep up with the demand.\n F: So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher.\n M: It was much more radical than that! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model.\n F: Oh, what's it like?\n M: Well, it's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less...\n F: Mmmm.\n M: and the components were designed from scratch.\n F: And what about production levels?\n M: They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market!\n F: Wow! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n M: Indeed it has.\n F: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n M: Yes. At the end of 1982 Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I--you know, the makers of Seiko watches-well, they unveiled an even smaller TV, around 3era, which is built into a wrist-watch.\n F: Incredible!\n M: It certainly is. The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes.\n F: And how does it work?\n M: It has a liquid crystal display screen. The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket, and they're connected by a cord to the watch.\n F: Is there a headphone?\n M: Oh, yes, that's plugged into the receiver as well.\n F: Seems a bit complicated, that one, with all the wires and bits and pieces.\n M: Yes, it does.\n F: Any other Japanese models?\n M: Yes, Casio-that's C-A-S-I-O. Their latest is a calculator-sized TV about one-third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month.\n F: I see.\n M: And, according to a spokesman, they hope to match their calculator sales, which are about 25 million units per year.\n F: Very impressive. And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon.\n M: Most likely.\n F: Now, could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs?\n M: Of course. From Sinclair in England there's one similar in size to the Casio, and their production levels were 1 million for 1983.\n F: Obviously they're planning on backing a winner!\n M: How right you are. A representative said they expect a mass-market response, not just a novelty item.\n F: And just which market are the manufactures aiming at?\n M: Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work.

And you should also do more exercise.\n M: I agree with you.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the best way to keep diet?\n\nChoices:\n(A) To eat less meat.\n(B) To eat less and exercise more.\n(C) To eat every kind of food.\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "model_prediction": "The best way to keep a diet is to eat less and exercise more. This means consuming a balanced diet that includes all types of foods, including vegetables and fruits, while also engaging in regular physical activity. Eating less meat may help reduce the risk of certain diseases, but it is not the only factor that contributes to a healthy diet. Additionally, eating every type of food can lead to unhealthy habits and make it difficult to maintain a balanced diet. Therefore, option (B) is the correct choice."

Sounds a little strange.\n W: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n M: That's a pretty long span of time.\n W: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\"\n M: Some squid are really huge.

Go ahead.\n Stacy: Okay. You know, Stephanie. [Yeah.] You're dating my sister, right? Stephanie. [Yeah, yeah.] Um, I think she's back on drugs.\n Brandon: What do you mean? I, I know she had a problem in the past, but she told me that that was over.\n Stacy: Well, that's what she says, but you know, I know my sister pretty well; I think I know her better than just about anyone else, and I know you guys have talked about getting married soon, and [Yeah] ... I'm pretty sure she's using drugs again, and you really need to, you need to know this ... you really need to face the facts, and you're going to have to deal with this now.\n Brandon: So, but, I ... again, how do you know?\n Stacy: She's doing some of the same stuff, you know, um, like. Well, like. Listen, you know. Um, you've noticed she's been skipping work lately?\n Brandon: Well, she said she's been having some health problems, so I just figured it was that.\n Stacy: No, no, no. She's not. [ Are you sure? ] Yeah. It's, it's more than that. Like, a month ago, she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car.\n Brandon: Wow. Man. Um, I mean, she didn't tell me anything like that. I mean, her car is running fine, I think.\n Stacy: Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it.\n Brandon: And, I let her borrow my car a couple days ago, and I had fifty bucks in there, and when the car came back, it was gone. She's ... I don't know how else it could have disappeared. [ Man. I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it.\n Stacy: I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week. I saw her with the two cell phones, and when I checked the texts on the one phone ....\n Brandon: Wait, wait. Two phones? What do you mean?\n Stacy: ....Yeah, umm.\n Brandon: She only has one.\n Stacy: No, she's got at least two phones, and when I checked the one phone, I saw some texts, and she was talking about, um, um, some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them.\n Brandon: Ah, man.\n Stacy: I'm sorry, Brandon, um, I ... we need to, we need to confront her on this. You need to confront her on this.\n Brandon: I don't know how to do this. I mean ... yeah, I don't know.\n Stacy: I know, but you've got to. You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ...\n Brandon: But, she might blow up.\n Stacy: She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ...\n Brandon: I just don't know.\n Stacy: I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger. She's probably going to end up losing her job, she's probably going to get arrested, and she might even die.\n Brandon: Man, you're probably right. I have to think about this and how to approach her. Alright. Let, let me thing about it, and I'll call you. [ Okay. ] Alright, thanks.\n Stacy: Alright.

Er, I'm arriving at the airport at 9 o'clock and taking off at 10 o'clock.\n W: What are you going to do in Italy? Lie on the beach and get nicely sun-tanned?\n M: I enjoy sunbathing on the beach. But this holiday is going to be a bit different. It's more of a cultural holiday. I hope to visit some museums, art galleries, taste a bit of the food and the drink, and experience the lifestyle of Italy.\n W: Sounds pretty interesting.\n M: Yeah, I've got a whole list of museums and art galleries. And in fact, I'm hiring a car in Milan so I can drive around a bit.\n W: That's a good idea. Hiring a car makes it easier to see the city. Well, actually I'm going to have a holiday which is rather different from yours.\n M: Where are you going then?\n W: Haven't decided yet. I may go to the beach and stay in a small hotel where I can watch the sea. I just want to take it easy, you know.\n M: I understand. You've worked too hard this semester. A bit of rest will do you good.\n W: That's true. Oh, Gosh! I've got to go now. Have a nice holiday!\n M: Thanks. You too!
