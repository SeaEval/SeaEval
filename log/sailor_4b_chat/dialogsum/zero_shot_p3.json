There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.\nLia: Good, I am pretty satisfied with your background. Do you think students should listen to more classical music than others and why?\nGlenna: Yes. Sometimes students can be stressful. Listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.\nLia: Okay, I think I've known enough of you. The interview is over.\nGlenna: Thank you for your time.\nLia: Oh, by the way. I think I may want to listen to some classical music. Do you have any suggestions?\nGlenna: You can find plenty of recording on the internet. You can search and listen to different classical music and see which interests you the most. You can also buy them very cheaply online if you like them.\nLia: That's a good idea. I'll try it.\nOutput:\n",
        "model_prediction": "Good morning! Thanks for coming. Let's get started. Why do you want to be a music teacher?\n\nLia: Because I've always loved music since I was young. And I hope I could have a job that matches my interest.\n\nGlenna: Do you have a degree in related fields?\n\nLia: Yes, I have a bachelor and a master degree in music and art.\n\nGlenna: Wow, that's very impressive. What kind of music do you like listening to?\n\nLia: I like many kinds of music. Sometimes I listen to the music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music."

And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty.\nIago: is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.\nHarry: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\nIago: of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. And then you may negotiate for a fair deal.\nOutput:\n",

First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly?\nMr. Fisher: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30.\nMs. Ross: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2.

Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\nMs. Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?\nMr. Fisher: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.\nMs. Ross: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal.\nMr. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before.\nMs. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday?\nMr. Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...\nMs. Ross: 100?!\nMr. Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.\nMs. Ross: Yes, but the room won't...\nMr. Fisher: But of course, haha...

All of the people who participated it had a great time, and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research.\nAvrom: So how does it work? How were you able to make money with the marathon?\nAdrea: Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee. Also, they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran. All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars.\nAvrom: Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society.\nAdrea: In all honesty, it's also a great deal for our company. The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community. We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign, plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause.\nOutput:\n",

Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax.

Is he enjoying it?\nMs. Ross: Very much, it's much more fun than being home!\nMr. Fisher: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business?\nMs. Ross: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly?\nMr. Fisher: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30.\nMs. Ross: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand?\nMr. Fisher: Yes, yes. Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end.\nMs. Ross: Better to have buffet lunch?\nMr. Fisher: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.\nMs. Ross: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.\nMr. Fisher: Oh, that'll be fine.\nMs. Ross: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.\nMr. Fisher: Free, fine, yes.\nMs. Ross: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?\nMr. Fisher: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\nMs. Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?\nMr. Fisher: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.\nMs. Ross: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal.\nMr. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before.\nMs. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday?\nMr. Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...\nMs. Ross: 100?!\nMr. Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.\nMs. Ross: Yes, but the room won't...\nMr. Fisher: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.\nMs. Ross: But what if they do? This room is the only one we have that day--there's a wedding reception in the banqueting rooms, so we...\nMr. Fisher: Well, in that case, I suppose...\nOutput:\n",

The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims, to reduce the chances of accidents.\nForster: Pilgrimages are common in many faiths.\nAntin: Yes. In England, Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages.\nForster: Isn't there a place in france where people go to get healed?\nAntin: I think that place is Lourdes. There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there.\nForster: Do you think that there is something magical about that place?\nAntin: Personally. I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them. I don't think place is magical in any way.\nOutput:\n",
