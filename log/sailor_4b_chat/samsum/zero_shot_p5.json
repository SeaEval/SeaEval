Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \nVic: What do u mean?\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.\nVic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me.

I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\nPhil: And does this motivate u to train?\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \nNancy: What do u think about Tumblr?\nPhil: What?\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\nNancy: It's a microblogging website.
