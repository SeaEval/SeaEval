As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nAnswer:\n",
        "model_prediction": "The correct answer is (B). The state extraction tax on pitchblende is likely invalid because Congress can use its general welfare power to regulate commerce among the states, including the taxation of goods like pitchblende. If Congress determines that the tax is harmful to the nation's general welfare, it can pass legislation to prohibit it. However, this would not necessarily place the state on an unequal footing with others (as choice (A) suggests), but rather limit its ability to tax a specific commodity within its jurisdiction. The supremacy clause (choice (D)) would typically be invoked to challenge laws that directly conflict with federal laws, but the issue"
