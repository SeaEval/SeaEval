These areas often have strict zoning regulations, community associations, and are created with the intention of providing a balanced mix of housing, commercial spaces, and green spaces for residents. Transition zones and ghettos are not typically characterized by planned communities, while Central Business Districts (CBDs) are primarily focused on commercial and office spaces rather than residential areas."

        "model_prediction": "Based on the lyrics provided from the song \"The Hayseed,\" it seems to be about the struggles faced by a poor farmer against the power of large corporations and the铁路 industry during the late 1800s. This theme is consistent with the issue of corruption in government, particularly in relation to big business, as it highlights the perception that these corporations were able to manipulate the system to their advantage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Corruption in government—especially as it related to big business—energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments."

The reasoning behind this is that the state tax on pitchblende is specifically targeted at a mineral that is unique to that state and not mined anywhere else. Since this tax affects the state's economy, Congress's action under the general welfare power, which allows for regulation to promote the common good, would be considered合理性.

        "model_prediction": "The AP Psychology examination administered by the College Board in May typically falls under the category of (A) achievement test. These tests are designed to assess students' knowledge and understanding of psychology concepts learned in high school, rather than measuring innate abilities or potential, which is what aptitude tests assess. Projective tests, like those used in psychometrics, are more focused on measuring personal qualities and unconscious thoughts through open-ended questions, while intelligence tests generally evaluate broader cognitive abilities. Intelligence tests are often administered separately, not specifically tied to a particular subject like psychology."
