You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something.\nIago: cool down, Harry! What are you really mad about? Did you get ripped off?\nHarry: yes. Last Sunday I went to a nearby market. It was on open-air fair. I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty.\nIago: is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.\nHarry: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\nIago: of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first.

First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax.

First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning.

And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.\nMr. Fisher: Free, fine, yes.\nMs. Ross: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?\nMr. Fisher: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\nMs. Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?\nMr. Fisher: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.\nMs. Ross: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal.\nMr. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before.\nMs. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday?\nMr. Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...\nMs. Ross: 100?!\nMr. Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.\nMs. Ross: Yes, but the room won't...\nMr. Fisher: But of course, haha...

And I knew the rest of my family would be interested.\nTim: Did you find it easy to get information?\nSimeon: Yeah, I discovered there were lots of people at my age trying to be green. I'd always gone to school by car. Catching a bus would be better, but there's no bus where we live. So I've gone for riding my bike to school now.\nTim: OK. And what about being green once you're actually at school?\nSimeon: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers.\nTim: And what about the school cafeteria?\nSimeon: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too. That something our school already does, but we still have machines with bottled milk, water and juices for sale. And I think we shouldn't have them. from Singapore-style English to standard English.

If there's one thing you don't want to hear, it's me singing. \nHenry Johnson: I sound like a frog that's suffering from a bad cold! But Karaoke is so popular in Asia that I've been dragged to at least two dozen of them so far. I've even learned a Chinese song or two. \nJameson: Hey. . . no Karaoke. . . no problem! We're here to have fun and if singing isn't fun. . . then forget it! I assume you like beer. \nPete: Beer is quite possibly my very favorite liquid. \nHenry Johnson: Chinese beer is actually pretty good. I've sampled all of them so I should know! \nJameson: Great! So we'll have dinner and then we'll go down to the bar district. In Beijing there are literally thousands of bars. \nPete: Sounds like a plan.  from Singapore-style English to standard English.

Pull up a chair. \nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \nEmily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \nSusan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax.

First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \nSusan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \nSusan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.
