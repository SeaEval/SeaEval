        "model_prediction": "(A) It enables people of different religions to live in harmony.\n\nSecularism in Singapore is important because it promotes a state that is neutral and does not favor any particular religion. This helps to create an environment where people of different religions can coexist peacefully, without the government interfering in religious affairs or discriminating against those who do not follow the state religion (which is Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity). By upholding secularism, the government ensures that religious diversity is respected and that religious tensions are minimized, fostering social cohesion and harmony."
