Question 1 is specifically about non-linear equation systems, which means equations that do not have a constant ratio between the variables (linear equations have a slope that is constant). The focus is on finding algorithms that can algebraically manipulate these equations to find solutions, rather than numerical methods that might be used for solving nonlinear equations.\n\n2.
