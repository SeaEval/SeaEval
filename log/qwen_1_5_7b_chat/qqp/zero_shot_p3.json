The first question specifies that the person doesn't have an SSN and prefers not to get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), while the second question is more general, inquiring about non-U.S. citizens who haven't obtained an SSN. The core concern in both cases is the same - navigating a banking scenario without an SSN. Therefore, the answer is (B)."

Question2: Why do people ask stupid questions on Quora that could be easily answered by Google?\nChoices:\n(A) The two questions are not semantically equivalent\n(B) The two questions are semantically equivalent\nAnswer:\n",
        "model_prediction": "(A) The two questions are not semantically equivalent.\n\nThe two sentences have different implications. Sentence 1 is a general inquiry about why people might choose to ask questions on Quora when they could find answers more quickly and accurately through Google. It does not necessarily imply that the questions asked are stupid or lack value.\n\nSentence 2, on the other hand, specifically calls out \"stupid\" questions and suggests that they could be easily answered by Google. This implies a negative judgment on the quality or relevance of those questions.\n\nTherefore, the two sentences have distinct meanings and are not semantically equivalent."

A world war, on the other hand, is a global conflict involving multiple nations with significant military and political involvement.

It seeks an evaluation of his nature beyond his physical appearance. The second question, \"Is Shah Rukh Khan bald?\" is specifically asking about his head hair and is a factual inquiry about his hairless state. These two questions have different focuses and are not related in terms of their meaning. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."

        "model_prediction": "(B) The two questions are semantically equivalent.\n\nBoth sentences convey the same essential information: a 23-year-old man is experiencing hair loss or hair fall and is seeking advice on how to prevent it. Although the phrasing is slightly different, the meaning and context are identical. The second sentence rephrases \"stop hair loss\" as \"prevent hair fall and hair loss,\" but the intent remains the same. Therefore, the semantic similarity is high, making the correct answer (B)."

Question 1 is about streaming a pre-recorded video on Facebook Live, which means uploading content that has already been filmed and then sharing it in real-time. On the other hand, Question 2 is about checking the number of live videos being streamed at the current moment on Facebook Live, which would provide a current count of ongoing broadcasts.\n\nAlthough both questions are related to Facebook Live, the focus of each is distinct, making them not semantically equivalent."

The difference lies in the phrasing - the first one is asking for just one joke, while the second one is asking for multiple jokes. However, the core meaning of seeking humorous content is the same in both cases."

Therefore, the meaning is slightly different despite being related."
