        "model_prediction": "The two questions are (B) not semantically equivalent.\n\nWhile both questions inquire about the facial proportions of historical figures, Lenin and Einstein, and whether those proportions are associated with low or high testosterone, the specific individuals being asked about differ. Facial proportions can be influenced by various factors, including genetics, environment, and cultural norms, and cannot be directly linked to testosterone levels without scientific research. Therefore, the meaning of the questions is different because they pertain to different people."

        "model_prediction": "The two questions are not semantically equivalent.\n\nExplanation:\nQuestion 1 is asking about the difference in the occurrence of collisions between systems that allow random access and those that allow controlled access. In a random access system, multiple users can access any part of the data simultaneously, which can lead to conflicts or collisions when multiple devices try to access the same location at the same time. In contrast, controlled access systems, such as file systems with locks or exclusive access, prevent collisions by limiting concurrent access.\n\nQuestion 2 is asking for a explanation of how zippers function, which is unrelated to the concept of collision in access control systems.\n\nTherefore,"

A memory map is a type of visual representation or organization of data in a computer's memory, often used in systems programming or operating systems, to facilitate access and understanding of where different pieces of data are stored. To answer this question, one would discuss the concept and benefits of using memory maps for studying or retaining information.\n\nQuestion 2, on the other hand, is specific to the technical aspect of identifying memory"
