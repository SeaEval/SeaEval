The structure and wording may differ slightly, but the key information and the idea being communicated are identical."

They both describe someone taking legal action (a \"court action\" or \"forfeiture action\") against Beacon Hill, which had $13 million when it closed, and freezing those assets. The terms \"begin a court action\" and \"initiate a forfeiture action\" can be considered synonyms, as they both refer to the process of starting a legal proceeding.
