        "model_prediction": "(B) The two sentences are paraphrase.\n\nBoth sentences convey the same essential meaning, although the structure and phrasing slightly differ. They both express that Rehnquist, likely in a legal or academic context, is stating that the use of race (or the system) in undergraduate admissions was not narrowly tailored to the university's goal of diversity. The terms \"not 'narrowly tailored'\" and \"was not narrowly tailored\" convey the same idea, and \"interest in educational diversity\" is a restatement of \"the university's asserted interest in diversity.\" Therefore, they are paraphrases of each other."

        "model_prediction": "(B) The two sentences are paraphrase.\n\nBoth sentences convey the same essential information, although they use slightly different phrasing. Both convey that someone has started a legal process (a \"court action\" or \"forfeiture action\") to seize assets from Beacon Hill, and that $13 million has been frozen, which was the amount the company had when it closed. The terms \"begin a court action\" and \"initiate a forfeiture action\" can be considered synonyms, as they both refer to starting a legal proceeding. Therefore, the meanings of the two sentences are essentially the same."

The slight difference lies in the choice of words (\"last 11 years\" vs. \"last decade\" and \"Southwestern town\" vs. \"tourist town\"), but they are not substantial enough to change the meaning significantly.
