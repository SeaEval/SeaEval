        "model_prediction": "(B) The two sentences are paraphrase\n\nBoth sentences convey the same essential information, with slight differences in phrasing but maintaining the same meaning. They both refer to Rehnquist stating that the use of race (or the system) was not narrowly tailored to achieve the university's interest in diversity. The terms \"use of race\" and \"the system\" are synonymous in this context, and \"interest in educational diversity\" is a restatement of \"university's asserted interest in diversity.\" Therefore, the sentences have high semantic similarity and can be considered paraphrases."
