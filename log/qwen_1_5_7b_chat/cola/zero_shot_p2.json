        "model_prediction": "The sentence \"John was lots more obnoxious than Fred\" is grammatically correct.\n\nExplanation:\nThe comparison \"lots more obnoxious\" is appropriate because it uses the comparative form of the adjective \"obnoxious\" (more obnoxious) to express that John is more so than Fred.
