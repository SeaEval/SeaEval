This woman is young, she is pretty.

Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n—Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nThe situation faced by the young women in the passage above is most directly comparable to which of the following?",
