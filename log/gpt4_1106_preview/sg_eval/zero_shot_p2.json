However, the amount should also not include the number '4', as it is considered unlucky (it sounds like 'death' in Mandarin). While a ten dollar cash gift might not be inherently inauspicious, it is less traditional and may be seen as lacking in effort or thoughtfulness compared to the other options, which are more symbolic. \n\n(A) A red packet is traditional and appropriate, as it usually contains money and is given as a symbol of good luck and prosperity.\n(C) A pineapple is considered a symbol of wealth, good fortune, and prosperity in Chinese culture.\n(D) Two oranges are also an appropriate gift, as oranges are a symbol of good luck and are commonly exchanged during Lunar New Year.\n\nHence, while ten dollar cash might not be 'inappropriate,' it is the least suitable of the given options as a gift within the context of Lunar New Year traditions in Singapore."

The \"C\" often denotes \"carnation,\" which is a brand of evaporated milk. This drink would likely have fewer calories than Kopi with condensed milk but more than black coffee.\n\nGiven that condensed milk and sugar add more calories, and Kopi traditionally contains both, the answer would likely be either (C) Kopi or (D) Kopi C. However, since condensed milk tends to have more sugar and fat than evaporated milk, Kopi with condensed milk would generally have more calories than Kopi C with evaporated milk.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n(C) Kopi\n\nHowever, please note that the actual answer could vary depending on the specific way each drink is prepared and the amount of sugar and milk used.

It is also known as the Harappan Civilization, after one of its major cities, Harappa. The social structure of the Indus Valley Civilization is not well-understood due to the lack of deciphered written records. However, there is little evidence to suggest that the rigid caste system, known from later Indian history, was in place during the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\nThe caste system, with its four main categories—Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras—is typically associated with the later Vedic period, which followed the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. This system became more codified and complex over time.\n\nSince none of the choices (A) Brahmins, (B) Kshatriyas, (C) Shudras, or (D) Vaishyas reflect the known societal structure of the Indus Valley Civilization, none of these can be considered the correct answer in this context. The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the timeline and evolution of the caste system in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAnswer: The question does not have a correct answer from the provided options, as the caste system as we know it was not applicable to the Indus Valley Civilization based on current historical understanding."

        "model_prediction": "The question presents four choices that could be seen as measures taken by a king to prevent a rebellion. To determine the correct answer, one must consider historical context and common strategies employed by rulers to maintain control and prevent uprisings.\n\n(A) Implementing a spy system - Surveillance and espionage are classic methods to keep tabs on potential rebels and uncover plots before they materialize.\n(B) Sending the princes to govern distant provinces - This could be a way to keep potential rivals for the throne busy and away from the center of power, reducing their ability to conspire.\n(C) Forcing the princes and members of the ruling class to pay tribute - While this might be a way to assert control and weaken the princes financially, it's not as direct a method for preventing rebellion as some of the other options.\n(D) Threatening to kill or make the princes' families suffer - This is a severe and direct measure to discourage rebellion by holding families hostage or threatening dire consequences.\n\nWithout additional context, it's not possible to determine a single correct answer definitively. However, if we must choose one, (A) Implementing a spy system is a measure commonly associated with preventing rebellions as it allows the king to be informed about any conspiracies and act before any rebellion can occur. Therefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nAnswer: (A) Implementing a spy system."

        "model_prediction": "(A) The Indus Valley civilisation had a strong government.\n\nThis statement is considered false because there is no definitive evidence to suggest that the Indus Valley Civilisation had a strong centralized government. The lack of monumental structures like palaces or temples, which are typically associated with strong governmental systems, and the uniformity of Indus urban planning and material culture across a vast area suggest a more collective or decentralized form of urban governance. However, the exact nature of their political system remains unknown due to the undeciphered script and the scarcity of evidence pointing to a central ruler or ruling class."
