Therefore, a sum like $10, which does not follow the usual customary practice, could be seen as less suitable than other amounts. However, it's important to note that this is a nuanced question and cultural practices can vary among individuals. \n\nThe other options, such as a red packet (A), a pineapple (C), and two oranges (D), are all considered suitable gifts. A red packet is a traditional gift containing money, a pineapple is symbolic of wealth, prosperity, and good fortune, and oranges represent abundance and happiness."

        "model_prediction": "(B) Learn new skills and stay adaptable\n\nPsychological Defence is one of the five pillars of Total Defence in Singapore, alongside Military, Civil, Economic, and Social Defence. It refers to the resilience of the population in the face of psychological warfare, misinformation, and other threats that can undermine a society's morale and unity.\n\nLearning new skills and staying adaptable contributes to psychological resilience by ensuring that individuals can cope with change, remain employable, and contribute to the nation's progress, thus reinforcing a sense of confidence and security within the society. While the other options listed may also be components of a strong psychological defence, they do not directly address the core idea of maintaining mental resilience and adaptability."

        "model_prediction": "(B) I should approach the Community Mediation Centre if we are unable to reach a consensus\n\nExplanation:\nIn Singapore, the preferred approach to resolving conflicts with neighbours is through communication and community mediation. It is often encouraged to first attempt to resolve the issue amicably by speaking directly to your neighbour about the problem. If the situation does not improve or if the neighbours are not receptive to discussion, the next step could be to seek help from the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), which provides mediation services to assist residents in resolving disputes in a peaceful and mutually agreeable manner. Reporting to the authorities is generally seen as a last resort after other methods have failed."

To answer the question, we need to identify the statement about John Crawfurd that is not true.\n\nJohn Crawfurd was indeed the second Resident of Singapore, succeeding William Farquhar. Therefore, option (B) is true.\n\nRegarding the Singapore Town Plan, it was Lieutenant Philip Jackson who carried out the Raffles Town Plan (also known as the Jackson Plan) in 1822, under the direction of Sir Stamford Raffles. While John Crawfurd did contribute to the administration of Singapore, he was not responsible for the original town plan. Therefore, option (A) is not true.\n\nCrawfurd also established measures to maintain law and order, which included starting a small police force. Thus, option (C) is true.\n\nRegarding land reclamation, it was not John Crawfurd who initiated major land reclamation projects along the seafront; significant land reclamation in Singapore occurred later, so option (D) could be considered not true in the context of his specific actions, although without more context on what the question implies by \"ordered land along the seafront to be reclaimed,\" it's difficult to definitively assess the truth of this statement.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely answer to the question is:\n(A) He carried out the Singapore Town Plan in 1823."

Gupta doctors (also known as Vaidyas) were indeed highly regarded for their knowledge of medicinal herbs and treatments.\n\nTo answer the question, while Gupta doctors likely knew how to use herbs for all of the listed purposes, the most comprehensive option that encompasses their skills would be:\n\n(A) dull pain and prevent infection\n\nThis choice reflects the broad knowledge of Gupta doctors in utilizing herbs for analgesic and antiseptic purposes, which are fundamental medical practices. However, it's important to note that the actual practices of Gupta doctors would have included a range of medical techniques and uses of herbs beyond just dulling pain and preventing infection."

Food is a central part of many cultures, and sharing a meal can be a gateway to deeper conversations and connections.\n\n(B) Ask a neighbor of a different race to explain more about their cultural practices - Engaging in open and respectful dialogue with people from different backgrounds can lead to greater understanding and appreciation of their traditions and beliefs. It can also help dispel stereotypes and build personal connections across cultural lines.\n\n(D) Take some online courses of other cultures - Education is a powerful tool for combating ignorance and fostering understanding. Online courses can provide structured and comprehensive learning about the histories, beliefs, and practices of different cultures, which can be especially useful for those who might not have the opportunity to engage directly with diverse communities.\n\nOption (C), on the other hand, is counterproductive to the goal of maintaining racial and religious harmony.

Unlike other ancient civilizations, there are no known monuments to rulers or clear indications of a centralized authority. The uniformity in urban planning and the standardized weights and measures suggest some form of organization, but it does not necessarily imply a strong government as seen in other contemporary civilizations like Egypt or Mesopotamia.
