        "model_prediction": "(D) Two oranges\n\nExplanation:\nIn Singapore, as in many parts of Asia, the number two is generally considered auspicious, especially during the Lunar New Year. Oranges, in particular, are symbolic of good luck and are often given in pairs. So option (D) \"Two oranges\" would not be considered unsuitable at all.\n\nHowever, if the question intends to find out which is the \"least suitable\" based on the practice of gift-giving during Lunar New Year, all the given options are actually quite suitable. Red packets (hongbao) containing money are traditional gifts, as are oranges, which symbolize wealth and good fortune. Pineapples are also considered auspicious because the Hokkien word for pineapple sounds like the phrase for \"prosperity come.\" Cash, if given in a red packet, would be perfectly suitable as well.\n\nIf we must select the least suitable from suitable options, the phrasing of option (B) \"Ten dollar cash\" might suggest just handing over cash without the red packet, which could be seen as less formal or thoughtful than presenting it within a red packet. If we take it literally that it is just cash without any red packet, then (B) \"Ten dollar cash\" might be the least suitable, but if it is understood to be in a red packet, it is also suitable.\n\nTherefore, without further context, all choices could be considered appropriate, but if we assume (B) is not in a red packet, then (B) would be the least suitable option. Otherwise, if all are presented in the customary way (with oranges in pairs, pineapple as a symbol of good luck, and cash inside a red packet), there isn't a clear \"least suitable\" option based on the information given."

        "model_prediction": "(B) Learn new skills and stay adaptable\n\nPsychological Defence is one of the five pillars of Total Defence in Singapore, alongside Military, Civil, Economic, and Digital Defence. It involves the resilience of the population in the face of psychological warfare, crises, and the ability to discern truth from falsehood. By learning new skills and staying adaptable, Singaporeans can maintain a resilient mindset that is capable of handling different challenges, including those that may affect their psychological well-being. This contributes to the nation's Psychological Defence by fostering a population that is mentally robust and resistant to attempts to undermine social cohesion or spread disinformation."

        "model_prediction": "(B) I should approach the Community Mediation Centre if we are unable to reach a consensus\n\nExplanation:\nIn Singapore, it is generally encouraged to resolve disputes amicably and through open communication. The first step in such a situation would typically be to have a polite conversation with the new neighbour to express your concerns and see if a mutual understanding can be reached. If the issue persists and a resolution cannot be found through direct communication, the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) can be approached. The CMC provides a neutral platform for parties to resolve their differences with the help of trained mediators, without having to resort to legal means. Reporting to authorities or involving other neighbours could escalate the situation unnecessarily and should be considered only if the issue continues unabated and affects the well-being or safety of residents."

While all the options could potentially be used by a ruler to maintain control, options (A), (B), and (D) are more directly related to preventing rebellions.

Unlike other ancient civilizations that left behind extensive writings or clear indications of a hierarchical structure led by kings or emperors, the Indus Valley Civilization has not yielded conclusive evidence of a centralized authority or powerful rulers. The absence of monumental palaces, royal tombs, or depictions of obvious leaders in the archaeological record suggests that their political system may not have been strongly centralized. Therefore, it is difficult to assert that they had a strong government with the information currently available."
