Additionally, employees are usually given several paid public holidays, which vary by employer and can include holidays such as New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, among others. The number of paid public holidays typically ranges from 6 to 10 days per year. Therefore, the most typical scenario for an American worker, especially one starting a new job, would be to receive around 10 days of paid vacation plus paid public holidays."

        "model_prediction": "(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate trade among the states and with foreign nations. If Congress decides to enact a law under this power, it generally has the ability to preempt state laws that conflict with federal legislation due to the Supremacy Clause, which states that the Constitution and federal laws made pursuant to it are the supreme law of the land. In this case, if Congress has determined that a state tax on the extraction of pitchblende is detrimental to the national interest, likely because of its importance to the national economy and its relationship to interstate commerce, then under the Supremacy Clause, the federal law would take precedence over the state law, rendering the state tax invalid."

While it can affect individuals of any gender, age, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background, research has shown that certain demographics and characteristics are more commonly associated with a higher risk of developing eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa.\n\nBased on the information provided in the choices and typical risk profiles, the most likely individual to develop anorexia nervosa would be:\n\n(B) Maria, a 16-year-old Caucasian female, who is an A student and talented musician, but who feels that her life is out of control\n\nThis choice suggests a profile that includes age, high achievement, and feelings of a lack of control, which are factors often associated with a higher risk for developing anorexia nervosa. Adolescence is a common time for the onset of eating disorders, and perfectionism or a sense of lack of control over one's life can contribute to their development. However, it's important to recognize that this does not mean individuals with these characteristics will definitely develop anorexia nervosa, only that they may be at a higher risk compared to the other profiles described."
