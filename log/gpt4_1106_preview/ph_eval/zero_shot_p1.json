        "model_prediction": "(C) Adultery\n\nIn the Philippines, under the law that was in effect traditionally, the crime of adultery could only be committed by a married woman and her paramour. The man could only be charged if he knew of the woman's marital status. However, this is not symmetrical, as a married man having sexual relations with a woman other than his wife could be charged with concubinage, which is a different offense and is treated less severely than adultery. Therefore, based on the options provided and the traditional laws, both a woman and a man cannot be charged with adultery, as the crime requires one party to be a married woman. It is important to note that legal provisions can change, and it's always best to check the current laws for the most accurate information."
