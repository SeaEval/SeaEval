However, I don't have the exact population numbers for each city from the 2020 Philippine Census, but I can provide a general idea based on known population trends prior to my knowledge cutoff in 2023.\n\nAs of the last updates before my knowledge cutoff:\n\n- Quezon City is the most populous city in Metro Manila, with a population of over 2.9 million.\n- Manila, the capital city, also has a significant population, with over 1.7 million people.\n- Caloocan comes next with a population of around 1.6 million.\n\nBased on these trends, let's analyze the given choices:\n\n(A) Caloocan is one of the most populous cities, so combining it with Muntinlupa and Marikina, which are both medium-sized cities, would likely exceed the population of any single city in Metropolitan Manila.\n\n(B) Pasig, Makati, and Taguig are all relatively populous cities. Their combined population would likely be too high to approximate the population of another single city.\n\n(C) Las Pinas, Valenzuela, and Muntinlupa are all medium-sized cities in terms of population. Their combined population might approximate one of the larger cities but is unlikely to be a close match.\n\n(D) San Juan is one of the least populous cities, while Pasay and Caloocan have larger populations. This combination could potentially approximate the population of a city that's larger than any of the three individually but smaller than the most populous cities like Quezon City or Manila.\n\nWithout exact figures, it's challenging to determine the most probable answer, but based on the given populations and the fact that Caloocan is a highly populous city, we can likely rule out choices (A) and (D) because they include Caloocan and would thus exceed the population of any other single city.\n\nBetween (B) and (C), (B) seems less likely because Pasig, Makati, and Taguig have significant populations on their own. Therefore, the most probable answer, based on a process of elimination and without exact figures, would be:\n\n(C) Las Pinas, Valenzuela, Muntinlupa\n\nThis combination seems the most likely to roughly equal the population of another city in Metropolitan Manila without"

For example, in some surveys, they accounted for about 55.8% of OFWs. \n\nSingapore is a popular destination for Filipino workers, and while it's challenging to state the exact number without current data, reports have often indicated that the number of OFWs in Singapore is in the tens of thousands.\n\nGiven the information typically available, a reasonable estimate might be that the number of female OFWs in Singapore is in the lower tens of thousands range.

The other options listed are not typically associated with warts:\n\n(A) Crocodylus mindorensis - This is the Philippine crocodile, a reptile not known for warts.\n(C) Sus cebifrons - This refers to the Visayan warty pig, which indeed has warts but is not typically classified under the \"Rana\" genus, as it is a mammal.\n(D) Rusa marianna - This is the Philippine deer, not known for warts.\n\nSince the question and choices seem to be a mix-up and there is no actual \"Rana magna,\" the best guess under the assumption of the question asking about an organism with warts would be (B) as it suggests an amphibian which could be associated with warts.

Since the exact date of the Junta's formation varies in records, if it was formed at any point in 1897, Gregorio del Pilar would have been 21 going on 22 years old. However, he was indeed a young officer in the Philippine Revolution, so the confusion likely stems from his general age during the period of the revolution rather than the specific date of the Hong Kong Junta's formation. \n\nThe most probable answer, based on the general historical context and the common knowledge of Gregorio del Pilar being a very young general during the Philippine Revolution, would be (D) 22, which is not listed in the choices provided. However, if we are to choose from the given options and consider the year of the formation of the Hong Kong Junta, none of the choices precisely match his age at the time. Since the provided answer must be chosen from the given options and none of them are completely accurate, the most reasonable approach is to select the closest answer, which would be:\n\n(B) 20\n\nThis would be assuming the Junta was formed late in 1897, after his 22nd birthday on November 14th."
