On the other hand, Question2 simply asks if Nigeria is in a recession, without any additional qualifiers. Therefore, the two questions are not asking the same thing and cannot be considered semantically equivalent."

        "model_prediction": "(B) The two questions are not semantically equivalent.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe two questions are not semantically equivalent because they have slightly different meanings. While both questions are asking about ways to make money, the first question specifically asks for the \"best\" way, which implies a preference for a particular method. The second question, on the other hand, does not mention the word \"best\" and is more general in its scope. Therefore, the two questions are not identical in meaning and cannot be considered semantically equivalent."
