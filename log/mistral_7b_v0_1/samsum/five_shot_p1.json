I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation.

He's really a darling.\nSophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\nNoah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\nSophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.\nNoah: OK.\nSophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield.

Like being married to your regiment!\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\nSophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\nNoah: You're probably right.

Then u can choose what to read and what not.\nNancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?\nPhil: Probably so. Not sure, though.\nNancy: How about u, Vic?\nVic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \nVic: What do u mean?\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.\nVic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.\nNancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?\nVic: I do. \nPhil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. \nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering.

I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\nPhil: And does this motivate u to train?\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \nNancy: What do u think about Tumblr?\nPhil: What?\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\nNancy: It's a microblogging website.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

        "model_input": "Dialogue:\nAndy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!\nAndy: No problem, speak soon.\n\nSummary:\nBetty's house has mould due to condensation.

        "model_input": "Dialogue:\nAndy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!\nAndy: No problem, speak soon.\n\nSummary:\nBetty's house has mould due to condensation. Andy will send her a quote for the work needed by Friday.\n\nDialogue:\nNancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;)\nPhil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.\nNancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?\nPhil: Probably so. Not sure, though.\nNancy: How about u, Vic?\nVic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \nVic: What do u mean?\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.\nVic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.\nNancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?\nVic: I do. \nPhil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. \nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.\nPhil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. \nVic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!\nPhil: So, what else?\nVic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\nPhil: And does this motivate u to train?\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \nNancy: What do u think about Tumblr?\nPhil: What?\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\nNancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!\nPhil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.\nVic: Me neither. \nPhil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)\nNancy: I have my reasons ;)\n\nSummary:\nNancy asks Vic and Phil about various social media, which prompts them to discuss and compare the different platforms.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great.

Is there something wrong?\nCharles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something\nMonica: Do you have any symptoms?

I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much\nKaren: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better\nMonica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now\nJack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\nMonica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens\nCharles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm\nMonica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat\nCharles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me\n\nSummary:\nCoeliac disease makes it impossible to digest gluten.

Whatever for? The crockery there is more for decoration.\nEmily: Exactly. I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are.

Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think?\nJess: I guess? \nCharlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.\nJess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?\nCharlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.\nLynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!\n\nSummary:\nJess dreamt she was a lion tamer.

They're not signing any contracts for now :)\nDon: Well, obviously not, but it's kind of cool that they'll be in a world database of peewee hockey players.\nHank: Yeah, I guess. So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm. 3 hours! I'll probably wait and work on the computer.\nDon: Bring a blanket :) It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours.\nHank: No shit :) Are you coming.\nDon: Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid :) \nHank: Hey, that's not fair! \nDon: I'll take the kids next time, I promise!\nHank: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\nBetty: Why is that?\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\nBetty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \nBetty: So what would you recommend?\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \nBetty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!\nAndy: No problem, speak soon.\n\nSummary:\nBetty's house has mould due to condensation.

I was thinking about working as a flight attendant. It would be easy for me to get that job since I can swim (and here it's obligatory) I'm even a water rescuer. I know English italian and polish and a bit of german.\nMargaret: So go ahead for it\nHayden: But to be honest , I don't think so that job is so great. I can't work there forever and I'm not that sure I wanna risk every time hahah since flight accidents happen\nMargaret: Hahahaha you shouldn't think about that\nHayden: But I don't wanna die hhahahahah\nMargaret: It would be good you would get to travel a lot\n\nSummary:\nHayden must write her thesis in 1 month.

So no Game of Thrones :)\nJoe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic\nTim: Got it :D \nJoe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? \nTim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... \nJoe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)\nTim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)\nTim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.\nJoe: yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :)\nTim: Will do that :)\n\nSummary:\nTim wants to organise a board games night for his colleagues.

How am I supposed to stop texting him? We have to communicate.\nTessa: I don't care. I don't want you texting my boyfriend :/ bye\n\nSummary:\nTessa doesn't like Chloe texting her boyfriend, Jim Andrews. Jim is Chloe's co-worker so Chloe needs to communicate with him.\n\nDialogue:\nGina: Hey love, do you have a free usb by any chance?\nMonica: Yes, I do :)\nGina: Can I come up to your office?\nMonica: Of course, usb's ready\nMonica: 2nd floor, room 112\nGina: Thanks!\n\nSummary:\n",

From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death\nJack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?\nCharles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something\nMonica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:\nMonica: <file_other>, <file_other>\nKaren: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me\nKaren: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine\nJack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine\nCharles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much\nKaren: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better\nMonica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now\nJack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\nMonica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens\nCharles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm\nMonica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat\nCharles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me\n\nSummary:\nCoeliac disease makes it impossible to digest gluten.
