This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following does the Supreme Court NOT have the power to override?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Presidential executive orders\n(B) Laws passed by Congress\n(C) Constitutional amendments\n(D) Laws passed by state legislatures\n\nAnswer:\n(C) Constitutional amendments\n\nQuestion:\nYour new ‘client is a 37-year-old woman whose symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following characteristics is NOT true of a state?\n\nChoices:\n(A) Internationally recognized\n(B) Boundaries\n(C) Independent territory\n(D) A national language\n\nAnswer:\n(D) A national language\n\nQuestion:\nThe United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v Wade is highly controversial because:\n\nChoices:\n(A) It failed to consider the rights of fathers.\n(B) The court failed to consider the medical evidence.\n(C) It overlooked the common law relating to abortion.\n(D) The majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) The majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy.\n\nQuestion:\nThe standard tip in a restaurant is $ 15 \\%$ of the bill before tax.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nChoices:\n(A) valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n(B) invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n(C) valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nAnswer:\n(D) invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nQuestion:\nAccording to the position statement Supervision in School Psychology published by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), which of the following is most accurate concerning school psychologists who will be supervising in a school district?\n\nChoices:\n(A) They should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential.\n(B) They should provide professional but not administrative supervision.\n(C) They are eligible to serve as supervisors after one year of experience as a school psychologist.\n(D) They need provide supervision only to school psychologists who are not fully certified or licensed and to any school psychology interns.\n\nAnswer:\n(A) They should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential.\n\nQuestion:\nThis question refers to the following information.\nHere is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende.
