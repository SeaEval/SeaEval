French are most likely to blame Americans. They use American's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem. Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity.

[Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics.

Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight?

It is sometimes a bit depressing. But you see the summers are amazing, from May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets. It's still light in the midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.\n W: Oh, yeah, the land of the midnight sun.\n M: Yeah, that's right, but it's wonderful. You won't stay up all night. And the Swedes makes most of it often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings. They'd like to work hard, but play hard, too. I think Londoners work longer hours, but I'm not sure this is a good thing.\nQuestion:\nWhat do Swedish people complain about when they visit England in winter?\nChoices:\n(A) The bad weather\n(B) The gloomy winter\n(C) The cold houses\nAnswer:\n",

Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all.\n M: Well, surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed. I mean, why should people, uhh...\n W: Well, they aren't being swarmed.\n M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here.\n W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often.\n M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.\n W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that. But it is still not really necessary to do, well, as it isn't necessary to, to conserve fuel and it is necessary to, well, not to waste land. I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more. I mean it could be used for farming for instance.\n M: True.\n W: It could also be used for housing, or it could be used for parks, you know. People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far.\n M: But, airports do bring some local advantages. They bring roads, there is obviously extra employment, for instance, new hotels, shops, restaurants will have to be built. This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy.\n W: But you ask the people, you ask those who are now living near the airports, for instance, whether,whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages, although, all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways, and the whole area is, is desolated, isn't it?\n M: But the airport infra, ..., infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport, the pilots even, the stewardess, they have to live somewhere near the airport, right?\n W: Yeah, but it's, it's just so, so damaging to the whole area. I think, airports, from my point of view, the whole concept is outdated, really. Umm, with modern technology, we can make a lot of travel unnecessary, really. For example, it won't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody. They can just leave it to the telephone in the office, press the button, and say to the person they want to do business with. You see, business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth, right?\n M: Yes, you are right. But for a lot of people, personal contact is important.

Would you like to join me for a drink?\n W: Ok, thanks.\n M: Any news recently?\n W: Oh, well, I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here, you know that?\n M: I'm afraid not.\n W: Well, my real objection to this idea of a new airport is, is the whole thing is so wasteful, I mean, we know we are currently in fuel crises, we know that we've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it, and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to, ... to travel, to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil, I mean it takes a ton of oil, a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off.\n M: Mm...\n W: It seems so completely short-sighted to me. Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all.\n M: Well, surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed. I mean, why should people, uhh...\n W: Well, they aren't being swarmed.\n M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here.\n W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often.\n M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.\n W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that. But it is still not really necessary to do, well, as it isn't necessary to, to conserve fuel and it is necessary to, well, not to waste land. I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more. I mean it could be used for farming for instance.\n M: True.\n W: It could also be used for housing, or it could be used for parks, you know. People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far.\n M: But, airports do bring some local advantages. They bring roads, there is obviously extra employment, for instance, new hotels, shops, restaurants will have to be built. This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy.\n W: But you ask the people, you ask those who are now living near the airports, for instance, whether,whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages, although, all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways, and the whole area is, is desolated, isn't it?\n M: But the airport infra, ..., infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport, the pilots even, the stewardess, they have to live somewhere near the airport, right?\n W: Yeah, but it's, it's just so, so damaging to the whole area. I think, airports, from my point of view, the whole concept is outdated, really. Umm, with modern technology, we can make a lot of travel unnecessary, really. For example, it won't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody. They can just leave it to the telephone in the office, press the button, and say to the person they want to do business with. You see, business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth, right?\n M: Yes, you are right. But for a lot of people, personal contact is important. And this means travel, and means quick travel, air travel. And we just need a new airport.\nQuestion:\nMary thinks that people don't need to do much travel nowadays as a result of ________.\nChoices:\n(A) less emphasis on personal contact\n(B) recent changes in people's concepts\n(C) advances in modern telecommunications\nAnswer:\n",

How boring!\n Tim: It's not boring at all! It was an amazing period of history. It changed everything in Europe. So what is your first lecture about?\n Jane: It's about animal behavior. It sounds really interesting.\n Tim: Look, I was on my way to the library. I'm going to get some of these books out and start reading for the first essay.\n Jane: And what have you got to write about?\n Tim: Well, you'll never believe it, I think our professor must have a sense of humor. He's given us the title \"Why study history?\"\n Jane: That's a good one. When you find the answer, let me know!\n Tim: I'm going to enjoy writing it. Have you been given any writing assignments yet?\n Jane: Yes, I've got to write about animal language.\n Tim: Hum! That sounds a challenge.

It's our house special this week, and it comes with fries, and a large specialty drink called \"Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink.\"\n Customer: A what? \"Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\"? What in the world is that?\n Server: Well, it's a little mix of everything in a large cup: Pepsi, Sprite, Fanta Orange, and lemonade with crushed ice and a scoop of ice cream.\n Customer: Ah, that sounds disgusting.\n Server: Hey, it'll grow on you.\n Customer: Nay, I think I'll just order a hamburger with some mustard and lettuce and a glass of water.\n Server: Boring. Hey. Would you care for anything else like a side order of amazing cheesy onion rings?\n Customer: No thank you. Onion rings usually don't agree with me.\n Server: Hmm. Okay. Your total comes to ten ninety ($10.90).\n Customer: Ten ninety? For just a hamburger?! You've got to be kidding\n Server: Well, the one-pound super deluxe hamburger is nine dollars.\n Customer: Hey, I didn't order a one-pound burger. I just wanted a simple burger. That's all.\n Server: Well, sir. Joe's Hamburger Restaurant only serves one-pound burgers. [Man!] The one-pound super hot and spicy, the one-pound barbecue burger, the one-pound bacon cheese burger, the one-pound ...\n Customer: No, no. Those are all huge.\n Server: Well, sir. If you really want something smaller [Yeah], you should order from the kids' menu: The half-pound super hot and spicy burger, the half-pound barbecue burger, the half-pound bacon cheese burger, the half-pound ...\n Customer: No. Those are still giant burgers.\n Server: Well, in these parts, we are hearty eaters.\n Customer: Okay, but you said my total was ten ninety, but the burger only comes to ten bucks. What about the other ninety cents?\n Server: Well, sir. We only serve natural spring water from yonder hills, and ...\n Customer: Okay, okay. I'll take the giant burger and a bottle of your spring water. The sandwich should feed me for a week.\nQuestion:\nWhat does the customer decide to do at the end of the conversation?\nChoices:\n(A) He decides to look for another place to eat.\n(B) He plans to come in a week when the prices are lower.\n(C) He orders something from the restaurant menu.\nAnswer:\n",

Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow!

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow!

But this holiday is going to be a bit different. It's more of a cultural holiday. I hope to visit some museums, art galleries, taste a bit of the food and the drink, and experience the lifestyle of Italy.\n W: Sounds pretty interesting.\n M: Yeah, I've got a whole list of museums and art galleries.

I may go to the beach and stay in a small hotel where I can watch the sea. I just want to take it easy, you know.\n M: I understand. You've worked too hard this semester.

And I hate photos that are out of focus. Is a camera like yours very expensive?\n W: Less than you'd expect. Why don't you check the prices that Headfields demonstrates? This model was on sale there last week.\n M: I think I will. It certainly won't hurt to take a look.\nQuestion:\nWhy doesn't the man carry a camera with him?\nChoices:\n(A) He has a professional photographer take picture for him.\n(B) He thinks a big camera would be too much trouble.\n(C) He doesn't think he knows enough about film processing.\nAnswer:\n",

Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all.\n M: Well, surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed. I mean, why should people, uhh...\n W: Well, they aren't being swarmed.\n M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here.\n W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often.\n M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.\n W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that. But it is still not really necessary to do, well, as it isn't necessary to, to conserve fuel and it is necessary to, well, not to waste land.

This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy.\n W: But you ask the people, you ask those who are now living near the airports, for instance, whether,whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages, although, all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways, and the whole area is, is desolated, isn't it?\n M: But the airport infra, ..., infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport, the pilots even, the stewardess, they have to live somewhere near the airport, right?\n W: Yeah, but it's, it's just so, so damaging to the whole area. I think, airports, from my point of view, the whole concept is outdated, really. Umm, with modern technology, we can make a lot of travel unnecessary, really. For example, it won't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody. They can just leave it to the telephone in the office, press the button, and say to the person they want to do business with. You see, business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth, right?\n M: Yes, you are right. But for a lot of people, personal contact is important.

Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all.\n M: Well, surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed. I mean, why should people, uhh...\n W: Well, they aren't being swarmed.\n M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here.\n W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often.\n M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool.\n W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n Guest: My pleasure.",

Actually, obesity has gone global.\n W: How did you do it?\n M: We interviewed 16,000 people in 16 countries.\n W: How large is the overweight population of the world according to your estimates?\n M: 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5.\n W: Really surprising, isn't it? And what are your findings about people's attitudes regarding obesity?\n M: Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin. 83% of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight. French are most likely to blame Americans. They use American's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem. Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity. They are followed by Germans and Indians. When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight, the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor.\n W: Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey, we will be back soon after the break.\nQuestion:\nHow many people in the world are rated as being overweight?\nChoices:\n(A) 16 million.\n(B) 1.6 billion.\n(C) 18 million.\nAnswer:\n",
        "model_prediction": "(B) 1.6 billion."

Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him.

Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n Guest: You just need to know how to care for them.\n Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick.\n Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ...\n Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No].\n Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n Program Host: Wow!

The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n M: Indeed it has.\n F: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n M: Yes.

The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes.\n F: And how does it work?\n M: It has a liquid crystal display screen. The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket, and they're connected by a cord to the watch.\n F: Is there a headphone?\n M: Oh, yes, that's plugged into the receiver as well.\n F: Seems a bit complicated, that one, with all the wires and bits and pieces.\n M: Yes, it does.\n F: Any other Japanese models?\n M: Yes, Casio-that's C-A-S-I-O. Their latest is a calculator-sized TV about one-third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month.\n F: I see.\n M: And, according to a spokesman, they hope to match their calculator sales, which are about 25 million units per year.\n F: Very impressive. And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon.\n M: Most likely.\n F: Now, could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs?\n M: Of course. From Sinclair in England there's one similar in size to the Casio, and their production levels were 1 million for 1983.\n F: Obviously they're planning on backing a winner!\n M: How right you are. A representative said they expect a mass-market response, not just a novelty item.\n F: And just which market are the manufactures aiming at?\n M: Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work. These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides.\n F: Well, thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget.\n M: My pleasure, and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs.",

In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman?\n F: Is that the Walkman?\n M: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial.\n F: How big is the whole thing?\n M: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms.\n F: Was it a success from the start?\n M: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price!\n F: Really?\n M: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections.\n F: Well, you never can tell!

That is just two weeks from now. Are you short of cash?\n W: No, I'm Okay.\n M: You'd better hurry up if you want a dorm room next September. There aren't enough rooms for every one, and first year students have priority.\n W: Well, I've been thinking about living off campus.\n M: Have you any idea of how much that would cost? There is the rent, utilities, and you'd probably need a car.\n W: I know it would be more expensive. I think I can handle it though. The dorm is just so noisy that I can't get anything done. Maybe my grades would be better if I had some peace and quiet in a place of my own.\n M: You should study in the library the way I do. Think of the money you'd save.\n W: I've got to think it over some more.

Er, I'm arriving at the airport at 9 o'clock and taking off at 10 o'clock.\n W: What are you going to do in Italy? Lie on the beach and get nicely sun-tanned?\n M: I enjoy sunbathing on the beach. But this holiday is going to be a bit different. It's more of a cultural holiday. I hope to visit some museums, art galleries, taste a bit of the food and the drink, and experience the lifestyle of Italy.\n W: Sounds pretty interesting.\n M: Yeah, I've got a whole list of museums and art galleries. And in fact, I'm hiring a car in Milan so I can drive around a bit.\n W: That's a good idea. Hiring a car makes it easier to see the city. Well, actually I'm going to have a holiday which is rather different from yours.\n M: Where are you going then?\n W: Haven't decided yet. I may go to the beach and stay in a small hotel where I can watch the sea. I just want to take it easy, you know.\n M: I understand. You've worked too hard this semester. A bit of rest will do you good.\n W: That's true. Oh, Gosh! I've got to go now. Have a nice holiday!\n M: Thanks. You too!
