        "model_prediction": " The answer is (B) 小腿.\n\nAfter beef is slaughtered, the quality of the meat in the leg area is generally better than in other parts of the body. This is because the leg muscles are used less for movement, so they are able to develop more marbling (fat) and tenderness. The leg is also a more tender cut of meat, making it a popular choice for roasting or grilling.\n\nTherefore, option (B) 小腿 is the correct answer."

Flow dikes are constructed to prevent water from flowing into a lake or other body of water, while lake dikes are constructed to prevent water from flowing out of a lake or other body of water. By constructing these dikes, the water level in the lake or other body of water will be reduced. Therefore, the answer is (C) decrease."
