        "model_prediction": " The correct answer is (B) Entailment.\n\nThe two sentences entail each other because the second sentence provides additional information about Adam's fluency in French, which is mentioned in the first sentence as the reason why Sam took French classes with him. Without the second sentence, it would not be clear why Sam chose to take classes with Adam. Therefore, the two sentences logically follow from each other and are entailments of each other."

In the second sentence, the sheep are described as looking more like golfers, which is a logical consequence of the first sentence. Therefore, the two sentences entail each other."
